Chapter 37: Crustle Arc: The Rocky Menace

Crustle’s Awakening
After being surfed upstream and thoroughly humiliated by Vaporeon, Crustle didn’t go sulk. No.
He ascended.
From crusty crab to chaotic crawler, he became the new menace of Poketopia.
Less tragic than Zeraora, but twice as troll, Crustle’s new goal: WALL EVERYONE INTO MISERY.

-

| Urshifu’s Dojo Incident
The first unlucky soul: Urshifu.
Deep in his peaceful dojo, meditating alongside a reformed Zeraora, a sudden SHELL SMASH shattered the silence, and the wall.
Crustle zoomed in, wedged both of them into an awkward corner.
Urshifu calmly sipped his tea. “We must endure this trial.”
Zeraora whispered, “This is what I used to be like? Ugh…”

Crustle cackled. “NEXT!”

-

| Miraidon’s Sandwich Sabotage
Zooming through the city on a sandwich run, Miraidon didn’t see it coming.
WHAM.
WALLED.

Crustle built a rock fortress mid-path and Miraidon faceplanted at full speed.
As he recovered, Crustle cheekily waved, “No sandwich for you, copper!”
Miraidon: “You’re under, ”
WALL! Another block. Another crash.
Sandwich? Ruined. Pride? Shattered.
Crustle? Already gone. On to his grudge list’s next name…

-

| Glaceon Gets Trolled
Back at her home ice cream stand, Glaceon hummed while moving coolers, until the smell of wet rock hit her nose.
Too late.

WALL.

Crustle cornered her, and to make it worse, Comfey floated in,  once a helpful nurse, now a leechy prankster.
Instead of healing Glaceon’s scraped knee, Comfey tied herself to her like a parasite.

Glaceon screamed and tried to freeze them both,  but they had overcharged heat pads.
Her outfit ruined, her cubes melting, she growled, “You’re lucky my husband isn’t here… yet…”

They fled. Cowards.

-

| Leafeon’s Revenge
But Crustle got cocky so he stayed to troll Leafeon.

Thinking Leafeon was an easy leafy meal, he tried to trash the garden.
Big mistake.

Leafeon brought out Aerial Ace, slicing through the troll’s barriers.
Crustle fought back with bug power, but tripped on a spilled fertilizer sack and fell into the sewer.

Defeated.
Stinky.

-

| Sewer Summit with Greedent
Down below, Greedent was munching garbage.
“Sup, crusty. Wanna troll Ttar again?”
Crustle grunted. “…Fine.”

-

| Operation: Manor Madness
They emerged from the toilet in Ttar’s mansion, disguised by soap and perfume.
But… oops.
Wrong restroom.
Girls’ room.

Tinkaton opened the stall and screamed, falling into Tyranitar’s arms, perfect bridal catch.
Ttar roared, activated Sand Tomb, trapping both trolls in a cyclone of grit.

Crustle tried building a sand fortress, but Greedent kept eating parts of it.

From Ttar’s arms, Tinkaton leapt forward, her hammer charged.
BONK.
Both got slammed into the pit.

-

Aftermath
Greedent: Now mopping floors at Ttar’s manor.
Crustle: Hauled off by Miraidon, who’d just returned for another sandwich trip.
This time, the law won.
