Figuring out project RAM requirements requires identifying the specific, active data your application needs to hold at one time, rather than just the total disk storage space. For most projects, 16 GB is considered the baseline for modern development or creative work, while specialized tasks like 3D modeling or heavy AI training require 32 GB to 64 GB or more. 
Here is a step-by-step approach to determining your project's RAM requirements:
1. Evaluate the Components of Usage
Operating System (OS) Overhead: Modern operating systems (Windows 11, macOS) need roughly 2–4 GB just to function smoothly.
Application Footprint: The primary software (e.g., Unity, IDE, Browser, Docker) requires memory to launch and manage assets.
Data Set/Model Size: For AI or data analysis, you must load your datasets into RAM.
Active User Count/Concurrency: For servers, each concurrent user or connection requires dedicated memory. 
2. Tailor by Project Type
Web/Software Development: 8 GB is the bare minimum, but 16 GB is the standard for running an IDE, local server, and browser concurrently.
Game Development: 16 GB is acceptable for small projects, but 32 GB is recommended to avoid stuttering during builds or while using tools like Unreal Engine.
Machine Learning/AI: A general rule of thumb is to have at least as much RAM as you have GPU VRAM, plus 25% for overhead.
Large Data Modeling: If working with Revit, a safe formula is (File Size) X 20, as data is uncompressed into the temp folder. 
3. Use Prototyping and Benchmarking 
Test on Real Hardware: Use a dev board or workstation, build a prototype, and run it under maximum expected load to observe actual usage.
Monitor Usage: Use Task Manager (Ctrl+Shift+Esc) on Windows or Activity Monitor on Mac to watch memory consumption in real-time.
Set a Safety Margin: If your application uses 10 GB during tests, you should have at least 16 GB (preferably 32 GB) to allow for system overhead and future scaling. 
4. General Recommendations
Casual/Office: 8 GB
Professional Programming/Gaming: 16 GB
Advanced Gaming/Dev/Video Editing: 32 GB
High-End 3D/AI/Heavy Virtualization: 64 GB+ 
Pro Tip: If you cannot easily upgrade RAM later (e.g., on some laptops), it is better to over-provision and buy more upfront.
