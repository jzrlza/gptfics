Average Episodes' Minutes = 30 minutes, 0.5 hours

maximum episodes digestable per run = 6 episodes (3 hours)
because other responsibilities need not to neglect
self autonomy should be preserved as well
and the anime producers are unable to tell you so

maximum episodes digestable per day = 3 runs = 18 episodes (9 hours)

The plan?

Weekends may seems ideal, but life storms can shit at you still... especially from parents. 
(I remember teen years a beef with parents was common via obsession)
Ok, fuck weekends...
Free time during work also... works literally... and is BETTER than weekends
Mondays to Thursdays are also ideal... but watch out for work assignments!! They need to be finished too.
Autonomy is not easy, but a proud one to have.
Mondays to Thursdays as long as it is not holiday are defenitely a way to go, but what if the show lingers memoery at night?? Well...

Week 1 = Punk Hazard
Week 2 = Dressrosa
Week 3 = Zou and Whole Cake
Week 4 = Reverie and Wano

Egghead and beyond? Wait til One Piece FINALLY concludes itself.
