self autonomy should be preserved as well

====Film and Fillers====

✅ Worthy Post-Time Skip Fillers (Recommended)

These are worth watching for added context, fun character moments, or movie tie-ins:

1. Z’s Ambition Arc (Episodes 575–578)

Context: Tie-in to Film Z

Set Between: Fishman Island and Punk Hazard

Why Watch: Introduces the Neo Marines and builds up Zephyr’s threat; good setup for the movie.

Verdict: ✅ Recommended



---

2. Silver Mine Arc (Episodes 747–750)

Context: Tie-in to Film Gold

Set Between: Dressrosa and Zou

Why Watch: Decent adventure with Luffy and Bartolomeo, minor insight into underworld bounty hunters.

Verdict: ⚪ Optional, but fun



---

3. Cidre Guild Arc (Episodes 895–896)

Context: Tie-in to Stampede

Set Between: Wano Part 1 and Part 2

Why Watch: Luffy and Hancock fight a soda-themed villain. Short, goofy, but entertaining.

Verdict: ✅ Short and worth it for fans of Hancock



---

4. Uta’s Past Arc (Episodes 1029–1030)

Context: Film Red tie-in

Set Between: Wano Act 2 and Act 3

Why Watch: Flashback to Uta and Luffy's shared childhood in Foosha Village. Oda confirmed it canonically fits.

Verdict: ✅ Highly recommended if watching Film Red

---

5. Post-Wano Episodes 1084–1085

Context: Fill-in content before Egghead Arc

Why Watch: Contains some wrap-up vibes from Wano and smooths transition.

Verdict: ⚪ Optional but not bad



---

❌ Unworthy Post-Time Skip Fillers (Skippable)

These don’t add much and are often slow, redundant, or irrelevant:

1. Caesar Retrieval Arc (Episodes 626–628)

Set Between: Punk Hazard and Dressrosa

Why Skip: Felt like a stalling arc. Doesn’t offer anything substantial about Caesar or Law’s plans.

Verdict: ❌ Skippable



---

2. Marine Rookie Arc (Episodes 780–782)

Set Between: Zou and Whole Cake Island

Why Skip: Unremarkable mission for food supplies at a Marine base. Doesn't connect to main plot.

Verdict: ❌ Skip unless desperate for comedy
