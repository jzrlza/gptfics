Average Episodes' Minutes = 30 minutes, 0.5 hours

maximum episodes digestable per run = 6 episodes (3 hours)
because other responsibilities need not to neglect
self autonomy should be preserved as well
and the anime producers are unable to tell you so

maximum episodes digestable per day = 3 runs = 18 episodes (9 hours)

4 major arcs, 2 mini-arcs

= 1559 minutes = 26 hours


The plan?

Weekends may seems ideal, but life storms can shit at you still... especially from parents. 
(I remember teen years a beef with parents was common via obsession)
Ok, fuck weekends...
Free time during work also... works literally... and is BETTER than weekends
Mondays to Thursdays are also ideal... but watch out for work assignments!! They need to be finished too.
Autonomy is not easy, but a proud one to have.
Mondays to Thursdays as long as it is not holiday are defenitely a way to go, but what if the show lingers memoery at night?? Well...

Week 1 = Punk Hazard
Week 2 = Dressrosa
Week 3 = Zou and Whole Cake
Week 4 = Reverie and Wano

Egghead and beyond? Wait til One Piece FINALLY concludes itself.

====Film and Fillers====

‚úÖ Worthy Post-Time Skip Fillers (Recommended)

---

3. Cidre Guild Arc (Episodes 895‚Äì896)

Context: Tie-in to Stampede

Set Between: Wano Part 1 and Part 2

Context: Film Red tie-in

Set Between: Wano Act 2 and Act 3

Context: Fill-in content before Egghead Arc

Why Watch: Contains some wrap-up vibes from Wano and smooths transition.

Verdict: ‚ö™ Optional but not bad



---

‚ùå Unworthy Post-Time Skip Fillers (Skippable)

These don‚Äôt add much and are often slow, redundant, or irrelevant:

1. Caesar Retrieval Arc (Episodes 626‚Äì628)

Set Between: Punk Hazard and Dressrosa

Verdict: ‚ùå Skippable



---

2. Marine Rookie Arc (Episodes 780‚Äì782)

Set Between: Zou and Whole Cake Island

Why Skip: Unremarkable mission for food supplies at a Marine base. Doesn't connect to main plot.

Verdict: ‚ùå Skip unless desperate for comedy



---

3. Carbonic Acid King Arc (Episodes 907)

Special Episode

Why Skip: Self-contained, product promotion (One Piece x Cup Noodle ad), extremely short and forgettable.

Verdict: ‚ùå Skippable curiosity



---

4. Special Recap Episodes (Multiple scattered)

Examples:

775: Zunesha recap

780s‚Äì790s: Many recap or reanimated summary episodes

895.5, 896.5, 1028.5, etc.: Summary specials between films or arcs

Verdict: ‚ùå Skip unless you need a refresh
