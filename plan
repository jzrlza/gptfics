Poketopia Unhinged 3 : Unlaughed

Mr.Crime saga
The bots will be the unhinged one, from funny to crying in agony

Absurd plot, unhinged logic behind why these guys are chosen, but also keep it reasonable.

Mime and Cram broke free after being separated from Buzzwole, Ceruledge and Armarouge due to Tinkaton lowering sentences to ease the mental healths.

Mime promised Cram eternal food, and is now his comedic foil assisant in villainy
Mime had a plan, to extract copies of themselves and targets due to how simple their power works:

===Themselves (the criminals, using normal bots):
//Mime (himself, an AI engineer himself)
//Cramorant (his new partner in crime, fellow inmate from vore-crimes)

===Others (weak bots) :
//Greedent (hard target, must find in sewer or in Ttar's manor)
//Blissey (easy target, just don't get mean looked by the hospital owner)

===Others (they can switch modes normally) :
//Cinderace (confirmed dead, but luckily for Mime, already extracted his DNA and powers before his death)
//Zeraora (average target, he would meditate and can be extracted DNA scan unnoticed, but his minds are sharp)
//Garchomp (hard target, he just keeps moving on between the meditation manor and school)
//Gengar (hard target, he used to be the biggest gacha scammer in city, but now he's lurking in Rapidash's manor, which Rapidash is not their target and would buck them if she sees them, also be careful of his bro pal Sableye as well, his bro pal is not in the list, he has record how he used to be an unknown name unidentified psudo-legendary, who loved bots until they killed everyone in his hometown Lavender Town, he reincarnated as Ghastly there in agony, alone, had to prank preys for a living, later turning himself into a Ghost Gengar today, making this harder and he could finally frown due to PTSD would trigger him if they said "robots" in front of him)
//Wigglytuff (hard target, almost always on world tour, tracking requires flight ability)
//Absol (easy target, he is a laid back one who is too much of a game nerd, just don't let Leafeon sees them)
//Pikachu (normal target, since he remembers Mime, also a laid back one, also avoid sights from Glaceon)
//Machamp (hard target, high risk of getting arrested while extracting his DNA)
//Lucario (hard target, just as dangerous as Machamp)
//Gardevoir (extremely hard target, very high risk of getting arrested by her back into her black hole... wait Tinkaton just lowered sentences for them doesn't she)
//Talonflame (hard target, is somewhere in this city, probably lives nearby Ho-Oh, which that divine bird is not their target)
//Mamoswine (easy target, is laid back on the house)
//Alolan Ninetales (easy target, too clumsy to notice)
//Slowbro (easy target, he would just say "bruh" and shrugs)
//Greninja (extremely hard target, this bounty hunter has a firefox seer girlfriend making him too smart to be scanned... maybe if they could hold his girlfriend hostage...)
//Venusaur (normal target, he often visit Charizards, look for low density population)
//Blastoise (normal target, try to to get water pumped)
//Charizard (normal target, just use Cramorant's poop again in front of his restaurant, but without that "war" this time)
//Snorlax (easy target, he kepts sleeping while guarding the hospital)
//Crustle (hard target, this guy used to be a big troll, he could wall himself against them)
//Sylveon (hard target, make sure the eevee kids don't notice at school while teaching, especially the fireboy, otherwise that affects the advanced bot target Espeon as well)
//Eldegoss (easy target, but rumor says she is the newest tailor shop owner in town, selling cheerleader costumes)

===Others (advanced bots, these are always unstable) :
//Trevenant (easy target, he just tends garden, a bit harder now that he is nearby Tsareena now)
//Dragonite (normal target, his coworkers could ruin everything, especially Mewoscarada, who is not the target)
//Espeon (hard target, if you thought her fireboy son isn't enough trouble, her husband could mean look them to oblivion, she would also alert Sylveon in the process, find an opening while she is in her library)
//Tyranitar (extremely hard target, the CEO, the chosen one, the Darkrai-slayer, he is the final boss of this DNA extraction, one mistake, back to getting bonked by Tinkaton, and back to Gardevoir's blackhole, if this completes, final boss on their side)


Climax, make sure Mime and Cram remains unserious, their stupidity would become their own downfall,
by accidentally make their AI bots went ramage frenzy, would become a big world-ending threat if Tyranitar-bot became frenzy.

The unstable bots could...
- ruins the indie game and brings gacha game back (Trevenant)
- makes the first opening to get Tyranitar bot and cause nightclub chaos (Dragonite)
- traumatize the eevee squads (Espeon)
- end the city, end the world, kill even those Rayquasa scammers (Tyranitar)

Special case :
//Duraludon (he is guarding Espeon while she is in her library, at least his DNA can be tested safely somehow)

Avoid :   (# DNAs can partially tested)
Decidueye (confirmed dead, no more threats left)
Tsareena (could be in the way for Trevenent)
Aegislash (highly concerning, could be in the way of Gengar, do not login to the indie game and get banned)
*Hoopa (whereabouts unknown)
Buzzwole (the darn inmate, hopefully he still in the prison)
Delphox (could either be in the way of Greninja... or, kidnaps her and bait him into getting scanned... unable to predict Mime's moves)
*Azumarill (whereabouts unknown)
*Mew (whereabouts unknown)
#Glaceon (just ignore her, don't let her tell Espeon or Sylveon)
Zoroark (do not get bounty too high, otherwise she will hunt them down)
*Dodrio (whereabouts unknown)
*Scizor (whereabouts unknown)
Urshifu (he is Zeraora's mentor and Garchomp's friend, do not provoke his ultimate wisdom)
Clefable (nurse that might be too close to Blissey)
Sableye (Gengar's bro pal, try to lure him to prank somewhere far from Gengar)
#Dragapult (do not order food from Espeon's son otherwise he would show up)
Comfey (can be in the way while getting Tyranitar's DNA, also a troll)
Lapras (don't jump the damn river, Slowbro won't show up that way, you'll get this ness lady instead)
Chandelure (no need to worry unless she is passing by)
#Goodra (guarding Espeon's library, making her a huge roadblock to get Espeon's DNA)
#Leafeon (just ignore him, don't let him tell Espeon or Sylveon)
#Umbreon (highly concerning, he can alert his wife Espeon and his old pal Tyranitar at the same time and can mean look)
Inteleon (just don't visit the bar)
Mimikyu (she blocks the way to Slowbro sometimes in her daycare)
Zacian (just as concerning as Aegislash)
*Mewtwo (whereabouts unknown)
Blaziken (don't get arrested by him otherwise game over)
Meowscarada (she could reports both Dragonite and Tyranitar, coworker and boss respectively)
Metagross (avoid staying in streets too long, especially for Cramorant not to be arrested by this thing again)
Gyarados (ignore him, he is doing community work and despite Blastoise anyway)
#Miraidon (same as Blaziken, getting arrested is over)
*Falinks (whereabouts unknown)
Ceruledge (keep him in prison)
Armarouge (keep him in prison as well)
Ho-Oh (do not kill anyone, otherwise he will see the whereabouts)
Darkrai (confirmed dead, no more threats left, and good riddance)
Psyduck (unintentionally used him to clutch out of the river after got Slowbro's DNA)
Tinkaton (self explainatory, avoid her, especially nearby Tyranitar, now her husband)
Galarian Rapidash (would be in the way to reach Gengar, avoid getting bucked out)
Suicune (do not attempt suicide, especially at river)
Alolan Raichu (sometimes flirting with Pikachu, but mostly laid back)



Extra concerns :
Do not provoke Rotom

Soon Tyanitarbot would steals Mime's spot as a new main villain, it will soon become Terminator in Poketopia, now that Tyranitarbot quickly realises he is being used as a tool, and it inherited his real-version's primal uncontrolled instincts.

Tyanitarbot then ordered every bots to form the new invasion formation, and grabs Mime firmly on his hand to show who is the new boss.

But Blisseybot and Greedetbot show signals that they are almost broken, but eventually obeys Tyranitarbot anyway.
