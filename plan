- Grass shows real time plant time lapse on how Grass Pokemons comments via temprature which will affect berry yields.
  Place: Tsareena's garden (features her children as well)
Script:
   Lil Eve, while in a steamy fountain house that settled since her parents studied and graduated university.... she calls her granpa Leafeon to start with Grass Element first, he then appoint Tsareena (now married to Trevenant and got Steenie and Plantump children) to turn her garden into an event center, several Grass fella gathered next day, Leafeon himself, Tsareena, Trevenant, Venusaur, Roserade, Liligant (brings her petil children along), Meowscarada (with her Spirgattito son), Sceptile, Chestnaught, and Eldegoss. There's a berry tree in a pot, whitin Tsareena's expanded and elegant garden, which all the grass mons can accelerate growth if it hits the right condition to grow, Lil Eve then studied the book about temperature vs plants, Venusaur then give hints that fertilizers needed, Meowscarada hints that this must finish within day time, Sceptile hints at the balance test which Trevenant offers himself to be a temperature gauge, choosing the correct spot for the berry to grow, Trev said too hot too cold multiple times, Eldegoss suggests a beauty spot, until Lil Eve found her right spot to put Berry Tree in, with watering and fertilizer added, all the grass mons gathereed to accelerate growth and with success, Leafeon hands her Leaf Plate, Lil Eve gained Mini Leaf Stone that partly absorbed into her, Grassy Vines ability, which can use to grapple hook in balanced temperature areas, and to turn her coat similar to her grandfather Leafeon, yet she can switch back to an Eevee normally at will.

- Water features swimming tunnels, with flows, and forage underwater to deliver to Water types, without drowning, use Grass ability to make it easier.
  Place: Greninja's luxurious ocean pool
Script:
   Later that night, Lil Eve is ready to take on Water element challenge next, before bed she asks her mom Vaporeon while her dad Flareon is preparing dinner, Vaporeon then appoints Greninja to gather Water mons into his luxorious yet eccentric swimming pool that is good at hiding stuffs, Water mons gathered next day, includes Vaporeon herself, Greninja, Blastoise, Gyarados, Slowbro, Psyduck (who refused to evolve to Golduck), Primarina, Azumarill, Inteleon, Swampert, Lapras, Suicune (now eldery but is here to prevent drowning suicide...). Wait... the pool is a maze, where there are several oxygen bubbles but with risk of drowning, with many currents along the way, Lil Eve then assigned by her mother to deliver stuffs to Water mons wating underwater, with her equipping scuba gears, but one item at a time, some of them are harder to reach than others. First item is a stainless ninja helmet to Greninja, then Extinguisher to Blastoise, Water-proof guitar to Azumarill, those were easy, but next got currents, luckily Grassy Vines made it easier to reach Gyarados for his Vesula meal, Primarina for her pearl, liquor bottle for Inteleon, dumbell for Swampert, next ones got stronger and mazier currents, stronger swimming will is needed, memory card to Slowbro, more Velusa meal to Psyduck, and finally boat ticket to Lapras, with Suicune used air bubble to prevent drowning at the end, once emerged from water, Vaporeon, with excited and worried look from her motherly instincts, handed Water Plate that eventually grants Lil Eve gained Mini Water Stone that absorbed into her, gaining Surf Waterfall ability, which can generate surge of water to cross rivers and cool self in the process, and turns her coat color similar to her mother's while using it, again, she can turn back Eevee without any costs. Vaporeon cried tears of joy to flood Greninja's pool, much to his comedic complaints.

- Fire features cooking and delivering to hungry Fire types, with right spiciness, while avoiding getting burned, easier with Water ability to extinguish.
  Place: Charizard's BlazeGrill Neo branch
Script:
   Later that night, Lil Eve is ready to take on Fire element challenge next, both Vaporeon and her daughter Lil Eve arrived soaked together, her husband and Lil Eve's father, Flareon finished dinner cooking then he got asked by Lil Eve about how "fired up" she is, he said he's "fired up" too, he calls to appoint Charizard to gather into his BlazeGrill's Neo branch located near geothermal greenhouse of city, the next day, several fire types are excited and fired up in here, Flareon himself, Charizard, Blaziken, Delphox, Incineroar (with his Litten daughter), Chandelure, Salazzle, Talonflame, and Ho-Oh (who is now eldery but still doing well for now). Lil Eve assigned by her father with kitchen and blacksmith tools to use with raw berries, veggies, and Vesula meat gathered near the huge grill, with lava furnance at bottom, first is Spicy test, Blaziken is seen swallowing a chilli whole without any pain, and Talonflame, Charizard and Ho-Oh were seen doing the same thing, much to Lil Eve's heat complaints, but her father also gulp chilli in half in front of her, encourage her for a nice start, she ate it and used Surf Waterfall instinctively to cool down herself in kitchen room and try to not unlit Chandelure in the process, next Blaziken ordered something simple, spicy corn berry fried, Delphox and Chandelure ordered fruit n fish treat in spicy flavor, both went well, but almost burned the fish in the process for Incineroar's and Salazzle's order, luckily the Surf Waterfall ability helped extinguish the fire, serving half burnt fish, Incineroar said he used to make this mistake many times and laughed anyway, she then cooked carefully for the rest, with special spicy treat for Ho-Oh, eventually her father hands her Fire Plate, it creates Mini Fire Stone absorbed into her and now she is more heat resistant and gained Flamethrower Trail ability, that uses flamethrower to leave burning trail temprary, it melts ice, burns grass, powered up with spicy food, and she can turn between her father's color pallete and her original coat colors. She accidentally burned a raw Vesula into ashes.

- Ice features icy platforms parkour, floors are slippery and who made it to waiting Ice Types pass, use Fire to make it easier but on solid platforms only.
  Place: Alolan Ninetale's blizzard parkour manor (her immortality made her insane enough to make it)
  
  Eventually an intermission from Regice will commands Articuno to attack (in a call center gang scam style), but she will use her robotic version instead while her real self just watches on TV, and ragequit after the defeat by Ninetales' immortality clutch and then tries to insults Regice back but failed to call.
Script:
   Later that night, Vaporeon is waiting at home with tons of water supplies, greeted by her husband Flareon and her daughter Lil Eve who recently can handle spiciness now, Lil Eve then calls her icy grandmother Glaceon for the Ice Element challenge next, Glaceon warned that her challenge is unhinged as cold hell, but Lil Eve accepts anyway, Glaceon then calls Alolan Ninetales to gather Ice pokemons into her icy dungeon challenge, next day, Glaceon herself and Alolan Ninetales with her eldery husband Mamoswine, and then Lapras with her icy friend Weavile, are here too, the dungeon is an insane icy parkour challenge that Alolan Ninetales used her immortality to create an unhinged challenge, but Mamoswine installed anti-fall-damage cushion anyway after his wife fell in pain but always survives everytime building the parkour challenge. Some of the platforms can be safely burned into solid platform, some of them will melt into nothingness, and they are all slippery, all held with cold-proof metals wrapped in anti-fall-damage cushions. Lil Eve, wearing in winter coat and winter skirt, has to start from bottom to top to reach the snowy peak, she then managed to overcome the slippery of icy platforms, and burned some menancing fall-guaranteed ice platforms into solid floors using Flamethrower Trail. At the top Alolan Ninetales congratz to her but slipped into the bottom anyway, she said ok, Weavile shrugs and said to back to congratz, Mamoswine and Lapras sighed at Ninetales' clumsiness, Glaceon then hands Lil Eve Ice Plate, that materializes Mimi Ice Stone absorbs into her, gaining slippery and cold resistance, and ability Frost Print, which can 3D print icicle sculpture to weaponize or be creative with it, and color pattern like Glaceon on her coat while using it.
   -
   But nearby, Articuno, who recently watched the parkour out of pure amusement, got a scam call center from Regice (who is still very far away), telling her to invade nearby icicle course for free money and asked Articuno's credit card details and photo of ruinations, Articuno don't want to get works dirty so she deployed Articuno-bot using stolen book from Duraludon to create such thing, Articuno-bot then invades and froze bottom half body of Lil Eve and Glaceon tried to defend her, Articuno-bot then blizzard Mamoswine and Lapras and Weavile away into unconcious, but then... Alolan Ninetales pounced the bot in Dazzing Gleam and ice walled the bot, Ninetales then said to Lil Eve to fire ball into the bot, and not to worry about her since she is immortal, Articuno bot then spike jabbed Ninetales, but this is for buying time only since she cannot die, Lil Eve then uses Flamethrower Trail, thawing herself out of icy cage and destroyed Articuno-bot in the process, Ninetales barely jumped out to escape the burn pain, and fully healed magically anyway. Articuno then ragequits and tried to insult call against Regice back but unable to call back, she then fled and printed several anti-scam call posters, but an Electrabuzz stole her Duraludon engineer book and an image of Zapdos, her fallen brother.

- Fairy features fashion and arts contests, with Fairy Pokemons to evaluate, Ice ability may help make sculptures.
  Place: Galarain Rapidash's manor
Script:
   Lil Eve rested for a day, and during a resting day, she visited Galarian Rapidash's manor and impressed both Galarian Rapidash and her husband Gastrier about ice sculptures, but Rapidash teases that there's more than just that, curious, that night Lil Eve called her now high school teacher, Sylveon to start Fairy challenge, luckily it is closed semester, so the transwoman teacher called Galarian Rapidash to gather other Fairy mons to her manor, next day, the manor gathored with Sylveon herself, Galarian Rapidash, Gardevoir, Alolan Ninetales (still immortal and want to see the new Frost Print ability), Alcremie, Wigglytuff, Zacian, Tinkaton (with her Tinkatuff daughter), Comfey (wrapping around Tinkaton), Mimikyu, Primarina and Azumarill (in a fish tank). Well it is simply an art class or test or something, Sylveon told Lil Eve, first test is Gardevoir's fashion, but her first drawing of Gardevoir's fashion is off, Gardevoir gave her constuctive crititism and eventually designed her beautiful of Tinkaton herself, but Tinkaton smashed it and request to use the shards to melt into her own blueprint, Eve then Frost Print into it, freezing the water inside, it shattered into the shape of Tinkaton in bridal dress, and Comfey wrapped that, next is Alolan Ninetales waiting saying "I'm the strongest" in front of an unamused Wigglytuff, Lil Eve then sculture using Frost Print with shape of Ninetales in her current dress singing happily with Wigglytuff in cute sailor outfit, Wigglytuff became so impressed, and so is Ninetales, Sylveon and Galarian Rapidash saw the art that promotes friendship in front, gave Lil Eve one final sculture art, it is Sylveon and Galarian Rapidash in frilly saddles and dresses enjoying the sunset together on cliff, with "Friendship is Magic" word at the bottom, Sylveon and Galarian Rapidash are impressed, Sylveon then gave Lil Eve Fairy Plate, it forms into Mimi Fairy Oval that absorbs into Lil Eve, Lil Eve gained Dazzling Gleam ability, that emits light in dark zones and can stun or blind opponents for a short while, and her coat can match Sylveon while using the ability. Meanwhile Gastrier came back and impressed by the ice scultures.

- Dark features a barely lit room, while navigating through Sableye's antics and various actions wether to punish him or not, Fairy ability makes it easier.
  Place: Tyranitar's manor's dungeon maze
Script:
   Later that night, Lil Eve after finished drank water brought by her mom Vaporeon, and ate dinner her dad Flareon made, she calls her strict and stoic grandpa doctor, Umbreon, the relative that seems pretty hard to approach to her the most, Umbreon asked his granddaughter his test is not for the faint hearted or not for softies, Lil Eve, curious, accepted with a gulp, while Flareon cheered her up that Umbreon is nicer than he looks. Umbreon then calls his former enemy that turned ally, Tyranitar, to assemble Dark pokemons for good this time, he promised not like first time and Darkrai stays dead and excluded. Next day, Dark pokemons gathered for Lil Eve this time, Umbreon himself, Tyranitar, Absol (Lil Eve is comfortable with this guy), Zoroark, Sableye (wearing an armor, holding anti-Darkrai sign to mock the evil dead), Incineroar, Meowscarada, Greninja, Weavile, and Urshifu in his one punch form. Lil Eve looked at Sableye and ask what is he holding, Umbreon told her don't ask, and he ordered everyone to hide themselves into dark mazes that Sableye would be her foil. Lil Eve gulped and scared, but Umbreon told her about pragmatism and used Foul Play on Sableye when he is stealing snacks (luckily is armored) to demonstrate some actions justified violence. Lil Eve of course enters the maze, with Sableye follows in corners in secret, the door for each is layered, allow Sableye's enough time to set up the test, the first is Absol playing a game together with Sableye, Lil Eve says hi to both and leaves the room, the room turns green, next room is Sableye stealing Meowscarada's jungle flower which the cat won't chase, Lil Eve left the room but it glows red, she gulped in horror, but Sableye said 80% is required no worries, she continues, next is Incineroar got food stolen from Sableye, Lil Eve then poke at Sableye harshly with "bad gremlin", Sableye thumbs up while knocked in full armor, Lil Eve left the room, it turned green, then the room with Sableye cleaning Tyranitar's body, she left and it turned green, another room with Sableye buzz joyed Zoroark, she poked Sableye again, room green, another with Sableye used broom against Weavile, Eve poked Sableye again, another green room, the one where Sableye is trolling Urshifu's meditation, another Eve poking Sableye, green light, the last is Sableye is "drowning" Greninja, Lil Eve got this one right, Greninja cannot drown, she left, the room is green. Then she got greeted by Umbreon handing her Dark Plate, Mimi Moon Stone created and absorbed into her into with Pulsive Foul Play which she can slaps enemies and inflicts mind-numbing strikes, with her coat can turn as dark as Umbreon as well. Sableye pranked Umbreon then Lil Eve poked Sableye with that ability, Sableye comically knocked to floor and thumbs up, Umbreon nodded in glee and Urshifu nodded in silence.

- Psychic features puzzles and mechanical lockers, some of them can be bypassed with Dark ability slaps if it asks too much.
  Place: Metagross' home of psychic archives
Script:
   Later that night, Lil Eve after finished drank water brought by her mom Vaporeon, and ate dinner her dad Flareon made, she calls her elegant librarian granny Espeon, then Espeon called Metagross to prepare his archival house into puzzle dungeon, next day the psychic mons gathered such as Espeon herself, Metagross, Delphox, Gardevoir, Galarian Rapidash, Slowbro, Psyduck, Mew, Mewtwo, and Hoopa, while Hoopa points arrows around for Eve to reach the location on her own. She is greeted with Psychic mons in front of her and greeted by Espeon and Metagross introducing the mind puzzles. Slowbro warns her that some puzzles can be too bullshit and too "bruh" that a dark ability can skip it. Lil Eve go through simple riddles and infographic puzzles that Espeon, Delphox, Gardevoir, Mew, Hoopa, Galarain Rapidash each wrote in their sensical language, then comes Mewtwo's bullshit puzzle logic that he absurdly wrote like how to divide by zero, Lil Eve notice how bullshit this is and used Pulsive Foul Play to skip the bullshit puzzle, Mewtwo said wtf in awe, but another puzzle made by Slowbro and Psyduck, the Slowbro one is bullshit spotted, while Psyduck one is sensible. Then comes Hoopa's portal puzzles, but it is total bullshit yet Hoopa is 4x weak to dark, so one Pulsive Foul Play into a portal is enough to solve it. The portal collapse and reveals Metagross' final puzzle. It is hard, but sensible, Lil Eve tried Pulsive Foul Play but useless, eventually she made it with mind-numbness, then door opens, greeted by Espeon that grants Lil Eve Psychic Plate that materializes Mini Sun Stone, absorb into Lil Eve and she gained Psybeam Focus, the ability can either shoot mental laser, or use it to levitate or shake objects, can create mini-quakes, along with her body pattern turns pink like Espeon while using it, Espeon said use it with caution and one of her maid robots offered some tea to her and her now successful granddaughter for breather. All the psychics then left back to Espeon's library for psychics night out celebration, while Lil Eve heading home after that.

- Electric features a techno room with circuit board logics, some of them can be Psychic ability to cause small earthquakes to correct the board.
  Place: Miraidon's security home
  
  Eventually an intermission from Regileki will commands a financially desperate Electrabuzz (call center gang scam style) to summon Zapdos bot to attack and invade, giving small hints to Regi about where Poketopia is, but Zapdos is only a bot now, his own will eventually dies here by Gardevoir's immortality clutch in desperaion to contain explosive in black hole. Regi gang then struggles to find Poketopia, takes them 3 weeks to reach.
Script:
   Later that night, Lil Eve after finished drank water brought by her mom Vaporeon, and ate dinner her dad Flareon made, she calls her parents' close friend and uncle figure, officer Jolteon, while he mistook as distress call at first, but turns out it is about her asking him for Electric elemental trial, with her parents excited and told Jolteon to take care of their daughter while testing. Jolteon eventually tells Miraidon to gather several Electric types into Miraidon's techno manor. Next day, several Electric mons gathered, Jolteon himself, Miraidon, Kantonian Raichu (who was the Pikachu from previous saga, outgrown his iconic past self) with his now wife Alolan Raichu (with several Pichus around), and Zeraora who now deeply respect Jolteon and Lil Eve's parents unlike his past self. The Trial is about circuit management, some of them requires Psybeam Focus to use mild earthquake to correct them, one of the puzzle is about powering K.Raichu's game console, which is easy, while Zeraora's meditation radio powering is tricky, as he laids lots of trickly cracks, but Psybeam Focus eventually overcome that anyway, making Zeraora impressed of the mental energy, another will charge A.Raichu's toaster, Lil Eve needs to becareful not to break it due to high power output, and then powering the car to reach Miraidon at the in-house racetrack to reach him via the vehicle that uses electric, Lil Eve uses Psybeam Focus to gently adjust the circuits and powers the vehicle, reaching the top window of the manor and at the roof, Jolteon jumped from Miraidon's back, handed Lil Eve Electric Plate, it materilizes Mini Thunder Stone, that absorbs into Lil Eve, she gained Electro Drift ability, allows her to dash with lightning and electrify things along the way and gain electric resistance, and gains Jolteon's color pattern in body while using it.
   -
   Meanwhile Electrabuzz watched the event in envy, as he is financially desperate, he then receives a scam call from Regileki (who is fortunately unware and too far away from event) randomly calling Electrabuzz that wrecking circuits and take pictures of wreckage would gain him millions of cash, he then deployed his recently finished Zapdos-bot, to invade the scene, Zapdos-bot then over-voltaged flashed Miraidon and Jolteon off the roof but both landed safely via skills, Lil Eve then uses Psybeam Focus to strangle Zapdos-bot, suddenly Gardevoir came with Arceus Elixir on her hand, handed by Hoopa after hearing Zapdos-bot invasion, Gardevoir then noticed Zapdos-bot also has a large explosion radius size of a city, Gardevoir, while in police uniform from Fairy event, and pencil skirt and sexy policewoman attire, tearfully sipped Arceus Elixir, as she is the only one that needs to hold the explosion inside her black hole and has to be alive even the explosion inside damages her within to fully contain it. Gardevoir absorbed black hole Zapdos-bot and it explodes inside her blackhole, Lil Eve let go of her psychic energy to see Gardevoir's body constantly bloody and then healthy again to contain the explosion, she then felt ok but sad that she has to see Lucario dies eventually one day. Gardevoir is now Hourai-immortal, forever in sexy policewoman outfit, 2 out of 6... Meanwhile Electrabuzz tried to flee but got captured by Miraridon and Jolteon for blueprint heist and recieveing scam call. However from far away, Regileki sense the wave of where the Poketopia is, but it still takes lots of time for Regi Six to fully figure out the wave hints.

Poketopia Unhinged 3 : Unlaughed

Mr.Crime saga
The bots will be the unhinged one, from funny to crying in agony

Absurd plot, unhinged logic behind why these guys are chosen, but also keep it reasonable.

Mime and Cram broke free after being separated from Buzzwole, Ceruledge and Armarouge due to Tinkaton lowering sentences to ease the mental healths.

Mime promised Cram eternal food, and is now his comedic foil assisant in villainy
Mime had a plan, to extract copies of themselves and targets due to how simple their power works:

===Themselves (the criminals, using normal bots):
//Mime (himself, an AI engineer himself)
//Cramorant (his new partner in crime, fellow inmate from vore-crimes)

===Others (weak bots) :
//Greedent (hard target, must find in sewer or in Ttar's manor)
//Blissey (easy target, just don't get mean looked by the hospital owner)

===Others (they can switch modes normally) :
//Cinderace (confirmed dead, but luckily for Mime, already extracted his DNA and powers before his death)
//Zeraora (average target, he would meditate and can be extracted DNA scan unnoticed, but his minds are sharp)
//Garchomp (hard target, he just keeps moving on between the meditation manor and school)
//Gengar (hard target, he used to be the biggest gacha scammer in city, but now he's lurking in Rapidash's manor, which Rapidash is not their target and would buck them if she sees them, also be careful of his bro pal Sableye as well, his bro pal is not in the list, he has record how he used to be an unknown name unidentified psudo-legendary, who loved bots until they killed everyone in his hometown Lavender Town, he reincarnated as Ghastly there in agony, alone, had to prank preys for a living, later turning himself into a Ghost Gengar today, making this harder and he could finally frown due to PTSD would trigger him if they said "robots" in front of him)
//Wigglytuff (hard target, almost always on world tour, tracking requires flight ability)
//Absol (easy target, he is a laid back one who is too much of a game nerd, just don't let Leafeon sees them)
//Pikachu (normal target, since he remembers Mime, also a laid back one, also avoid sights from Glaceon)
//Machamp (hard target, high risk of getting arrested while extracting his DNA)
//Lucario (hard target, just as dangerous as Machamp)
//Gardevoir (extremely hard target, very high risk of getting arrested by her back into her black hole... wait Tinkaton just lowered sentences for them doesn't she)
//Talonflame (hard target, is somewhere in this city, probably lives nearby Ho-Oh, which that divine bird is not their target)
//Mamoswine (easy target, is laid back on the house)
//Alolan Ninetales (easy target, too clumsy to notice)
//Slowbro (easy target, he would just say "bruh" and shrugs)
//Greninja (extremely hard target, this bounty hunter has a firefox seer girlfriend making him too smart to be scanned... maybe if they could hold his girlfriend hostage...)
//Venusaur (normal target, he often visit Charizards, look for low density population)
//Blastoise (normal target, try to to get water pumped)
//Charizard (normal target, just use Cramorant's poop again in front of his restaurant, but without that "war" this time)
//Snorlax (easy target, he kepts sleeping while guarding the hospital)
//Crustle (hard target, this guy used to be a big troll, he could wall himself against them)
//Sylveon (hard target, make sure the eevee kids don't notice at school while teaching, especially the fireboy, otherwise that affects the advanced bot target Espeon as well)
//Eldegoss (easy target, but rumor says she is the newest tailor shop owner in town, selling cheerleader costumes)

===Others (advanced bots, these are always unstable) :
//Trevenant (easy target, he just tends garden, a bit harder now that he is nearby Tsareena now)
//Dragonite (normal target, his coworkers could ruin everything, especially Mewoscarada, who is not the target)
//Espeon (hard target, if you thought her fireboy son isn't enough trouble, her husband could mean look them to oblivion, she would also alert Sylveon in the process, find an opening while she is in her library)
//Tyranitar (extremely hard target, the CEO, the chosen one, the Darkrai-slayer, he is the final boss of this DNA extraction, one mistake, back to getting bonked by Tinkaton, and back to Gardevoir's blackhole, if this completes, final boss on their side)


Climax, make sure Mime and Cram remains unserious, their stupidity would become their own downfall,
by accidentally make their AI bots went ramage frenzy, would become a big world-ending threat if Tyranitar-bot became frenzy.

The unstable bots could...
- ruins the indie game and brings gacha game back (Trevenant)
- makes the first opening to get Tyranitar bot and cause nightclub chaos (Dragonite)
- traumatize the eevee squads (Espeon)
- end the city, end the world, kill even those Rayquasa scammers (Tyranitar)

Special case :
//Duraludon (he is guarding Espeon while she is in her library, at least his DNA can be tested safely somehow)

Avoid :   (# DNAs can partially tested)
Decidueye (confirmed dead, no more threats left)
Tsareena (could be in the way for Trevenent)
Aegislash (highly concerning, could be in the way of Gengar, do not login to the indie game and get banned)
*Hoopa (whereabouts unknown)
Buzzwole (the darn inmate, hopefully he still in the prison)
Delphox (could either be in the way of Greninja... or, kidnaps her and bait him into getting scanned... unable to predict Mime's moves)
*Azumarill (whereabouts unknown)
*Mew (whereabouts unknown)
#Glaceon (just ignore her, don't let her tell Espeon or Sylveon)
Zoroark (do not get bounty too high, otherwise she will hunt them down)
*Dodrio (whereabouts unknown)
*Scizor (whereabouts unknown)
Urshifu (he is Zeraora's mentor and Garchomp's friend, do not provoke his ultimate wisdom)
Clefable (nurse that might be too close to Blissey)
Sableye (Gengar's bro pal, try to lure him to prank somewhere far from Gengar)
#Dragapult (do not order food from Espeon's son otherwise he would show up)
Comfey (can be in the way while getting Tyranitar's DNA, also a troll)
Lapras (don't jump the damn river, Slowbro won't show up that way, you'll get this ness lady instead)
Chandelure (no need to worry unless she is passing by)
#Goodra (guarding Espeon's library, making her a huge roadblock to get Espeon's DNA)
#Leafeon (just ignore him, don't let him tell Espeon or Sylveon)
#Umbreon (highly concerning, he can alert his wife Espeon and his old pal Tyranitar at the same time and can mean look)
Inteleon (just don't visit the bar)
Mimikyu (she blocks the way to Slowbro sometimes in her daycare)
Zacian (just as concerning as Aegislash)
*Mewtwo (whereabouts unknown)
Blaziken (don't get arrested by him otherwise game over)
Meowscarada (she could reports both Dragonite and Tyranitar, coworker and boss respectively)
Metagross (avoid staying in streets too long, especially for Cramorant not to be arrested by this thing again)
Gyarados (ignore him, he is doing community work and despite Blastoise anyway)
#Miraidon (same as Blaziken, getting arrested is over)
*Falinks (whereabouts unknown)
Ceruledge (keep him in prison)
Armarouge (keep him in prison as well)
Ho-Oh (do not kill anyone, otherwise he will see the whereabouts)
Darkrai (confirmed dead, no more threats left, and good riddance)
Psyduck (unintentionally used him to clutch out of the river after got Slowbro's DNA)
Tinkaton (self explainatory, avoid her, especially nearby Tyranitar, now her husband)
Galarian Rapidash (would be in the way to reach Gengar, avoid getting bucked out)
Suicune (do not attempt suicide, especially at river)
Alolan Raichu (sometimes flirting with Pikachu, but mostly laid back)



Extra concerns :
Do not provoke Rotom

Soon Tyanitarbot would steals Mime's spot as a new main villain, it will soon become Terminator in Poketopia, now that Tyranitarbot quickly realises he is being used as a tool, and it inherited his real-version's primal uncontrolled instincts.

Tyanitarbot then ordered every bots to form the new invasion formation, and grabs Mime firmly on his hand to show who is the new boss.

But Blisseybot and Greedetbot show signals that they are almost broken, but eventually obeys Tyranitarbot anyway.
