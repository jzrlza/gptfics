Poketopia: Unhinged 4 - It's About Life Types


Scripts:

Lil Eve, while in a steamy fountain house that settled since her parents studied and graduated university....
when choosing elements, she needs to appoint and call first (except for Water and Fire which can be told directly via her parents)

The element master will schedule event, each takes day, and it is closed semester.

- Grass shows real time plant time lapse on how Grass Pokemons comments via temprature which will affect berry yields.
  Place: Tsareena's garden (features her children as well)
Script:
   Lil Eve, while in a steamy fountain house that settled since her parents studied and graduated university.... she calls her granpa Leafeon to start with Grass Element first, he then appoint Tsareena (now married to Trevenant and got Steenie and Plantump children) to turn her garden into an event center, several Grass fella gathered next day, Leafeon himself, Tsareena, Trevenant, Venusaur, Roserade, Liligant (brings her petil children along), Meowscarada (with her Spirgattito son), Sceptile, Chestnaught, and Eldegoss. There's a berry tree in a pot, whitin Tsareena's expanded and elegant garden, which all the grass mons can accelerate growth if it hits the right condition to grow, Lil Eve then studied the book about temperature vs plants, Venusaur then give hints that fertilizers needed, Meowscarada hints that this must finish within day time, Sceptile hints at the balance test which Trevenant offers himself to be a temperature gauge, choosing the correct spot for the berry to grow, Trev said too hot too cold multiple times, Eldegoss suggests a beauty spot, until Lil Eve found her right spot to put Berry Tree in, with watering and fertilizer added, all the grass mons gathereed to accelerate growth and with success, Leafeon hands her Leaf Plate, Lil Eve gained Mini Leaf Stone that partly absorbed into her, Grassy Vines ability, which can use to grapple hook in balanced temperature areas, and to turn her coat similar to her grandfather Leafeon, yet she can switch back to an Eevee normally at will.

- Water features swimming tunnels, with flows, and forage underwater to deliver to Water types, without drowning, use Grass ability to make it easier.
  Place: Greninja's luxurious ocean pool
Script:
   Later that night, Lil Eve is ready to take on Water element challenge next, before bed she asks her mom Vaporeon while her dad Flareon is preparing dinner, Vaporeon then appoints Greninja to gather Water mons into his luxorious yet eccentric swimming pool that is good at hiding stuffs, Water mons gathered next day, includes Vaporeon herself, Greninja, Blastoise, Gyarados, Slowbro, Psyduck (who refused to evolve to Golduck), Primarina, Azumarill, Inteleon, Swampert, Lapras, Suicune (now eldery but is here to prevent drowning suicide...). Wait... the pool is a maze, where there are several oxygen bubbles but with risk of drowning, with many currents along the way, Lil Eve then assigned by her mother to deliver stuffs to Water mons wating underwater, with her equipping scuba gears, but one item at a time, some of them are harder to reach than others. First item is a stainless ninja helmet to Greninja, then Extinguisher to Blastoise, Water-proof guitar to Azumarill, those were easy, but next got currents, luckily Grassy Vines made it easier to reach Gyarados for his Vesula meal, Primarina for her pearl, liquor bottle for Inteleon, dumbell for Swampert, next ones got stronger and mazier currents, stronger swimming will is needed, memory card to Slowbro, more Velusa meal to Psyduck, and finally boat ticket to Lapras, with Suicune used air bubble to prevent drowning at the end, once emerged from water, Vaporeon, with excited and worried look from her motherly instincts, handed Water Plate that eventually grants Lil Eve gained Mini Water Stone that absorbed into her, gaining Surf Waterfall ability, which can generate surge of water to cross rivers and cool self in the process, and turns her coat color similar to her mother's while using it, again, she can turn back Eevee without any costs. Vaporeon cried tears of joy to flood Greninja's pool, much to his comedic complaints.

- Fire features cooking and delivering to hungry Fire types, with right spiciness, while avoiding getting burned, easier with Water ability to extinguish.
  Place: Charizard's BlazeGrill Neo branch
Script:
   Later that night, Lil Eve is ready to take on Fire element challenge next, both Vaporeon and her daughter Lil Eve arrived soaked together, her husband and Lil Eve's father, Flareon finished dinner cooking then he got asked by Lil Eve about how "fired up" she is, he said he's "fired up" too, he calls to appoint Charizard to gather into his BlazeGrill's Neo branch located near geothermal greenhouse of city, the next day, several fire types are excited and fired up in here, Flareon himself, Charizard, Blaziken, Delphox, Incineroar (with his Litten daughter), Chandelure, Salazzle, Talonflame, and Ho-Oh (who is now eldery but still doing well for now). Lil Eve assigned by her father with kitchen and blacksmith tools to use with raw berries, veggies, and Vesula meat gathered near the huge grill, with lava furnance at bottom, first is Spicy test, Blaziken is seen swallowing a chilli whole without any pain, and Talonflame, Charizard and Ho-Oh were seen doing the same thing, much to Lil Eve's heat complaints, but her father also gulp chilli in half in front of her, encourage her for a nice start, she ate it and used Surf Waterfall instinctively to cool down herself in kitchen room and try to not unlit Chandelure in the process, next Blaziken ordered something simple, spicy corn berry fried, Delphox ordered fruit n fish treat in spicy flavor, both went well, but almost burned the fish in the process for Incineroar's order, luckily the Surf Waterfall ability helped extinguish the fire, serving half burnt fish, Incineroar said he used to make this mistake many times and laughed anyway, she then cooked carefully for the rest, with special spicy treat for Ho-Oh, eventually her father hands her Fire Plate, it creates Mini Fire Stone absorbed into her and now she is more heat resistant and gained Flamethrower Trail ability, that uses flamethrower to leave burning trail temprary, it melts ice, burns grass, powered up with spicy food, and she can turn between her father's color pallete and her original coat colors. She accidentally burned a raw Vesula into ashes.

- Ice features icy platforms parkour, floors are slippery and who made it to waiting Ice Types pass, use Fire to make it easier but on solid platforms only.
  Place: Alolan Ninetale's blizzard parkour manor (her immortality made her insane enough to make it)
  
  Eventually an intermission from Regice will commands Articuno to attack (in a call center gang scam style), but she will use her robotic version instead while her real self just watches on TV, and ragequit after the defeat by Ninetales' immortality clutch and then tries to insults Regice back but failed to call.

- Fairy features fashion and arts contests, with Fairy Pokemons to evaluate, Ice ability may help make sculptures.
  Place: Galarain Rapidash's manor

- Dark features a barely lit room, while navigating through Sableye's antics and various actions wether to punish him or not, Fairy ability makes it easier.
  Place: Tyranitar's manor's dungeon maze

- Psychic features puzzles and mechanical lockers, some of them can be bypassed with Dark ability slaps if it asks too much.
  Place: Metagross' home of psychic archives

- Electric features a techno room with circuit board logics, some of them can be Psychic ability to cause small earthquakes to correct the board.
  Place: Miraidon's security home
  
  Eventually an intermission from Regileki will commands a financially desperate Electrabuzz (call center gang scam style) to summon Zapdos bot to attack and invade, giving small hints to Regi about where Poketopia is, but Zapdos is only a bot now, his own will eventually dies here by Gardevoir's immortality clutch in desperaion to contain explosive in black hole. Regi gang then struggles to find Poketopia, takes them 3 weeks to reach.


Villains : Regigigas (planned to have Diavolo death loop punishment), Regice, Registeel, Regirock, Regileki, Regidraco










8 megaman-like + Gym Leaders like trials
13 years after the trilogy (it is a teen-rated fic so the protag, newborn Eevee better be a teen than a kid, timeskip is huge)
But with Team Rocket-like antagonist but Pokeball + Slavery theme
contains blood, death, psycho drama, suicide, but no more gore, no more toilet humor, no more vore

Poketopia Unhinged 3 : Unlaughed

Mr.Crime saga
The bots will be the unhinged one, from funny to crying in agony

Absurd plot, unhinged logic behind why these guys are chosen, but also keep it reasonable.

Mime and Cram broke free after being separated from Buzzwole, Ceruledge and Armarouge due to Tinkaton lowering sentences to ease the mental healths.

Mime promised Cram eternal food, and is now his comedic foil assisant in villainy
Mime had a plan, to extract copies of themselves and targets due to how simple their power works:

===Themselves (the criminals, using normal bots):
//Mime (himself, an AI engineer himself)
//Cramorant (his new partner in crime, fellow inmate from vore-crimes)

===Others (weak bots) :
//Greedent (hard target, must find in sewer or in Ttar's manor)
//Blissey (easy target, just don't get mean looked by the hospital owner)

===Others (they can switch modes normally) :
//Cinderace (confirmed dead, but luckily for Mime, already extracted his DNA and powers before his death)
//Zeraora (average target, he would meditate and can be extracted DNA scan unnoticed, but his minds are sharp)
//Garchomp (hard target, he just keeps moving on between the meditation manor and school)
//Gengar (hard target, he used to be the biggest gacha scammer in city, but now he's lurking in Rapidash's manor, which Rapidash is not their target and would buck them if she sees them, also be careful of his bro pal Sableye as well, his bro pal is not in the list, he has record how he used to be an unknown name unidentified psudo-legendary, who loved bots until they killed everyone in his hometown Lavender Town, he reincarnated as Ghastly there in agony, alone, had to prank preys for a living, later turning himself into a Ghost Gengar today, making this harder and he could finally frown due to PTSD would trigger him if they said "robots" in front of him)
//Wigglytuff (hard target, almost always on world tour, tracking requires flight ability)
//Absol (easy target, he is a laid back one who is too much of a game nerd, just don't let Leafeon sees them)
//Pikachu (normal target, since he remembers Mime, also a laid back one, also avoid sights from Glaceon)
//Machamp (hard target, high risk of getting arrested while extracting his DNA)
//Lucario (hard target, just as dangerous as Machamp)
//Gardevoir (extremely hard target, very high risk of getting arrested by her back into her black hole... wait Tinkaton just lowered sentences for them doesn't she)
//Talonflame (hard target, is somewhere in this city, probably lives nearby Ho-Oh, which that divine bird is not their target)
//Mamoswine (easy target, is laid back on the house)
//Alolan Ninetales (easy target, too clumsy to notice)
//Slowbro (easy target, he would just say "bruh" and shrugs)
//Greninja (extremely hard target, this bounty hunter has a firefox seer girlfriend making him too smart to be scanned... maybe if they could hold his girlfriend hostage...)
//Venusaur (normal target, he often visit Charizards, look for low density population)
//Blastoise (normal target, try to to get water pumped)
//Charizard (normal target, just use Cramorant's poop again in front of his restaurant, but without that "war" this time)
//Snorlax (easy target, he kepts sleeping while guarding the hospital)
//Crustle (hard target, this guy used to be a big troll, he could wall himself against them)
//Sylveon (hard target, make sure the eevee kids don't notice at school while teaching, especially the fireboy, otherwise that affects the advanced bot target Espeon as well)
//Eldegoss (easy target, but rumor says she is the newest tailor shop owner in town, selling cheerleader costumes)

===Others (advanced bots, these are always unstable) :
//Trevenant (easy target, he just tends garden, a bit harder now that he is nearby Tsareena now)
//Dragonite (normal target, his coworkers could ruin everything, especially Mewoscarada, who is not the target)
//Espeon (hard target, if you thought her fireboy son isn't enough trouble, her husband could mean look them to oblivion, she would also alert Sylveon in the process, find an opening while she is in her library)
//Tyranitar (extremely hard target, the CEO, the chosen one, the Darkrai-slayer, he is the final boss of this DNA extraction, one mistake, back to getting bonked by Tinkaton, and back to Gardevoir's blackhole, if this completes, final boss on their side)


Climax, make sure Mime and Cram remains unserious, their stupidity would become their own downfall,
by accidentally make their AI bots went ramage frenzy, would become a big world-ending threat if Tyranitar-bot became frenzy.

The unstable bots could...
- ruins the indie game and brings gacha game back (Trevenant)
- makes the first opening to get Tyranitar bot and cause nightclub chaos (Dragonite)
- traumatize the eevee squads (Espeon)
- end the city, end the world, kill even those Rayquasa scammers (Tyranitar)

Special case :
//Duraludon (he is guarding Espeon while she is in her library, at least his DNA can be tested safely somehow)

Avoid :   (# DNAs can partially tested)
Decidueye (confirmed dead, no more threats left)
Tsareena (could be in the way for Trevenent)
Aegislash (highly concerning, could be in the way of Gengar, do not login to the indie game and get banned)
*Hoopa (whereabouts unknown)
Buzzwole (the darn inmate, hopefully he still in the prison)
Delphox (could either be in the way of Greninja... or, kidnaps her and bait him into getting scanned... unable to predict Mime's moves)
*Azumarill (whereabouts unknown)
*Mew (whereabouts unknown)
#Glaceon (just ignore her, don't let her tell Espeon or Sylveon)
Zoroark (do not get bounty too high, otherwise she will hunt them down)
*Dodrio (whereabouts unknown)
*Scizor (whereabouts unknown)
Urshifu (he is Zeraora's mentor and Garchomp's friend, do not provoke his ultimate wisdom)
Clefable (nurse that might be too close to Blissey)
Sableye (Gengar's bro pal, try to lure him to prank somewhere far from Gengar)
#Dragapult (do not order food from Espeon's son otherwise he would show up)
Comfey (can be in the way while getting Tyranitar's DNA, also a troll)
Lapras (don't jump the damn river, Slowbro won't show up that way, you'll get this ness lady instead)
Chandelure (no need to worry unless she is passing by)
#Goodra (guarding Espeon's library, making her a huge roadblock to get Espeon's DNA)
#Leafeon (just ignore him, don't let him tell Espeon or Sylveon)
#Umbreon (highly concerning, he can alert his wife Espeon and his old pal Tyranitar at the same time and can mean look)
Inteleon (just don't visit the bar)
Mimikyu (she blocks the way to Slowbro sometimes in her daycare)
Zacian (just as concerning as Aegislash)
*Mewtwo (whereabouts unknown)
Blaziken (don't get arrested by him otherwise game over)
Meowscarada (she could reports both Dragonite and Tyranitar, coworker and boss respectively)
Metagross (avoid staying in streets too long, especially for Cramorant not to be arrested by this thing again)
Gyarados (ignore him, he is doing community work and despite Blastoise anyway)
#Miraidon (same as Blaziken, getting arrested is over)
*Falinks (whereabouts unknown)
Ceruledge (keep him in prison)
Armarouge (keep him in prison as well)
Ho-Oh (do not kill anyone, otherwise he will see the whereabouts)
Darkrai (confirmed dead, no more threats left, and good riddance)
Psyduck (unintentionally used him to clutch out of the river after got Slowbro's DNA)
Tinkaton (self explainatory, avoid her, especially nearby Tyranitar, now her husband)
Galarian Rapidash (would be in the way to reach Gengar, avoid getting bucked out)
Suicune (do not attempt suicide, especially at river)
Alolan Raichu (sometimes flirting with Pikachu, but mostly laid back)



Extra concerns :
Do not provoke Rotom

Tyranitarbot : 5 kills (Roserade, Liligant, Salazzle, Pheromosa, Falinks), 1 KO (Tinkaton, indirectly via Zapdos' summon), destroyed by his real self Tyranitar (aided by Comfey and redeemed Mr. Mime, died peotically along with Ray 5.0, that also indirectly caused Zapdos' defeat in outer space via Mr. Mime's sacrafice)
Durabot : 0 kills, 0 KO, not destroyed, preserved by his real self Duraludon for better moral use
Tyranitarbot's Moral Event Horizon = Brutally killed all his 5 victims, Used Falinks' body violently to summon Zapdos, brutally commanded Blisseybot and Greedentbot to war anyway despite their weakened conditions, Summoned Zapdos who is one of the most forbidden creature in existence with explosion radius of a moon, Set the war in motion in the first place and betrayed Mr. Mime







Soon Tyanitarbot would steals Mime's spot as a new main villain, it will soon become Terminator in Poketopia, now that Tyranitarbot quickly realises he is being used as a tool, and it inherited his real-version's primal uncontrolled instincts.

Tyanitarbot then ordered every bots to form the new invasion formation, and grabs Mime firmly on his hand to show who is the new boss.

But Blisseybot and Greedetbot show signals that they are almost broken, but eventually obeys Tyranitarbot anyway.
