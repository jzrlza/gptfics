Poketopia Unhinged 3 : Unlaughed

Mr.Crime saga

Mime and Cram broke free after being separated from Buzzwole, Ceruledge and Armarouge due to Tinkaton lowering sentences to ease the mental healths.

Mime promised Cram eternal food, and is now his comedic foil assisant in villainy
Mime had a plan, to extract copies of themselves and targets due to how simple their power works:

Themselves (the criminals, using normal bots):
Mime (himself, an AI engineer himself)
Cramorant (his new partner in crime, fellow inmate from vore-crimes)

Others (weak bots) :
Greedent (hard target, must find in sewer or in Ttar's manor)
Blissey (easy target, just don't get mean looked by the hospital owner)

Others (they can switch modes normally) :
Cinderace (who sadly had died, but luckily for Mime, already extracted his DNA and powers before his death)
Zeraora (average target, he would meditate and can be extracted DNA scan unnoticed, but his minds are sharp)
Garchomp (hard target, he just keeps moving on between the meditation manor and school)
Gengar (hard target, he used to be the biggest gacha scammer in city, but now he's lurking in Rapidash's manor, which Rapidash is not their target and would buck them if she sees them)
Wigglytuff (hard target, almost always on world tour, tracking requires flight ability)
Absol (easy target, he is a laid back one who is too much of a game nerd, just don't let Leafeon sees them)
Pikachu (normal target, since he remembers Mime, also a laid back one, also avoid sights from Glaceon)
Machamp (hard target, high risk of getting arrested while extracting his DNA)
Lucario (hard target, just as dangerous as Machamp)
Gardevoir (extremely hard target, very high risk of getting arrested by her back into her black hole... wait Tinkaton just lowered sentences for them doesn't she)
Talonflame (hard target, whereabouts currently unknown, probably lives nearby Ho-Oh, which that divine bird is not their target)
Mamoswine (easy target, is laid back on the house)
Alolan Ninetales (easy target, too clumsy to notice)
Slowbro (easy target, he would just say "bruh" and shrugs)
Greninja (extremely hard target, this bounty hunter has a firefox seer girlfriend making him too smart to be scanned... maybe if they could hold his girlfriend hostage...)
Venusaur (normal target, he often visit Charizards, look for low density population)
Blastoise (normal target, try to to get water pumped)
Charizard (normal target, just use Cramorant's poop again in front of his restaurant, but without that "war" this time)
Snorlax (easy target, he kepts sleeping while guarding the hospital)
Crustle (hard target, this guy used to be a big troll, he could wall himself against them)
Sylveon (hard target, make sure the eevee kids don't notice at school while teaching, especially the fireboy, otherwise that affects the advanced bot target Espeon as well)
* Eldegoss (unknown, haven't yet appeared, but rumor says she is the newest tailor shop owner in town, selling cheerleader costumes)

Others (advanced bots, these are always unstable) :
Trevenant (easy target, he just tends garden, a bit harder now that he is nearby Tsareena now)
Dragonite (normal target, his coworkers could ruin everything, especially Mewoscarada, who is not the target)
Espeon (hard target, if you thought her fireboy son isn't enough trouble, her husband could mean look them to oblivion, would also alert Sylveon in the process, find an opening while she is in her library)
Tyranitar (extremely hard target, the CEO, the chosen one, the Darkrai-slayer, he is the final boss of this DNA extraction, one mistake, back to getting bonked by Tinkaton, and back to Gardevoir's blackhole, if this completes, final boss on their side)


Climax, make sure Mime and Cram remains unserious, their stupidity would become their own downfall,
by accidentally make their AI bots went ramage frenzy, would become a big world-ending threat if Tyranitar-bot became frenzy.

The unstable bots could...
- ruins the indie game and brings gacha game back (Trevenant)
- makes the first opening to get Tyranitar bot and cause nightclub chaos (Dragonite)
- traumatize the eevee squads (Espeon)
- end the city, end the world, kill even those Rayquasa scammers (Tyranitar)
