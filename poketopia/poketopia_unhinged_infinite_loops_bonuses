Bonus Scene: The Grid of No Return
Within the cold, clinical halls of the Death Loop Tablet’s deepest layer, Mortillian Pikachu wandered aimlessly, still clinging to his delusion of being the protagonist.

"There’s gotta be a way out… there’s always a way out for a Pikachu like me… I just need… a glitch, a cutscene, a rewind…"

He dashed down a sterile corridor, the walls lined with eerie reflective panels, chasing a nonexistent escape route.

Suddenly, the ceiling hummed.
A crisscrossing laser grid flickered to life, beams moving with cold, mechanical precision.

"Hah! I’ve seen this trope. I can dodge this. I’m Pikachu, I’m the ma, "

He zipped to the left, one laser grazed his tail.
He jumped forward, another laser sliced just before his ears.

"Tch, close… but easy. I’ll make it through, I always, "

The grid shifted patterns, 
A rapid checkered wall of lasers surged toward him.

His eyes widened in horror as he realized, 

This pattern was unsolvable. On purpose.

"W-Wait, wait, WAIT, CUT TO BLACK, SOMEONE, ANYONE, "

Schlick. Schlick. Schlick. Schlick. Schlick.

The grid passed through him like butter, cutting him into perfectly diced, equal-sized cubes. His last conscious moment was fragmented across those pieces, unable to process his own dismemberment.

The walls calmly beeped:
"Simulation complete. Resetting."

His body respawned, intact, back at the corridor entrance. The laser grid reappeared, as precise as before.

"No… no no no no, "

Run. Laser. Dice. Respawn. Run. Laser. Dice. Respawn.

Over.
And over.
And over.

The Death Loop Tablet had no sympathy.
Mortillian Pikachu wasn’t a protagonist.
He was just another discarded data point.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Bonus Scene: Cramorant Beatdown in the Death Loop Bubble
In the endless corridors of the Death Loop Bubble, Mortillian Pikachu found himself in yet another randomized simulation room. This time, the floor was littered with fish bones, remnants of Gulp Missile victims. The air smelled faintly of saltwater and blood.

From the shadows, a flock of Cramorant boys emerged, each with scarred beaks, street punk vibes, and matching black bandanas loosely tied around their necks.
These weren’t ordinary Cramorants.
These were the Rowdy Beaks.

Mortillian Pikachu crossed his arms, smirking with that typical delusional bravado.
"Tch, water birds? Really? I thought this Death Loop Bubble was supposed to punish me. Y’all just fast food with wings."

The Cramorants paused.

"What? I’m not wrong. You guys are just stupid loot drop birds, "*

CRUNCH.
One Cramorant smashed its beak into Mortillian Pikachu’s gut, knocking the wind out of him.

"H-Hey, " WHACK, a second one clipped his face with a Gulp Missile fish.

Another Cramorant SPAT a Gulp Missile fish at his leg, knocking him over.
Before he could crawl away, the entire gang swarmed him.

THUMP. THWACK. CRUNCH. SMACK.
The stomps came mercilessly from all directions, beaks, webbed feet, missiles, feathers, anything.

"Tch, tch, wait, y-you can’t, "
SMACK.

"I-I’m still the, "
WHACK.

"The… the mai, "
CRUNCH.

"…n…"
SQUELCH.

They tore through his meat, shredded his fur, plucked his tail off like a chew toy.
One Cramorant stuffed Mortillian’s ear into its gullet, another scarfed his toes like appetizers.

Even if he hadn't insulted them, they would’ve devoured him anyway, it’s just that now, they were doing it with theatrical, joyful violence.

When his body fully collapsed into a splattered mess, the walls beeped again.

"Simulation complete. Respawn initiated."

Mortillian Pikachu’s form regenerated in a flash, pristine, only to see the Rowdy Beaks cracking their necks and ready for round two.

"N-No, wait, I’ll behave, I’ll, "

THWOMP.
No mercy.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Bonus Scene: The Ralts Incident ,  No Escape From Oblivion
After countless gang-stomps by the Rowdy Beaks, Mortillian Pikachu respawned into yet another randomized simulation room.

This time, it was strangely quiet.

The air shimmered with soft pastel hues. In the middle of the room, standing alone, was a small Ralts. Unknown gender. Innocent-looking. Their hands calmly held together, their helmet-like head barely tilting up to notice him.

Mortillian Pikachu’s tail bristled. His fur stood on end.

"No… NO, no way, no way, I know this trope, "
He backpedaled frantically.
"The little ones are the worst ones!!"

His paranoia screamed. In his twisted mind, even this Ralts could be the next executioner.

"You think I’ll fall for that ‘innocent kid’ setup?! I’m NOT dying to some storybook weakling! I’m the real, "
His eyes twitched. His pulse surged.

Mortillian Pikachu lunged, charging a Thunderbolt aimed straight for the Ralts’ head.

But the Ralts didn’t even flinch.

They simply whispered:
"…Moonblast Blackhole."

CRACK, BWOOOOOM.

A sphere of radiant energy instantly expanded into a collapsing blackhole, swallowing Mortillian Pikachu’s entire form in a fraction of a second.

His attack evaporated. His body stretched, spiraled, and then blinked out of existence.

The room restored itself quietly, like nothing happened.

The Ralts blinked once. "…Self-defense."
Then they walked away, leaving nothing behind.

Simulation complete. Respawn initiated.

Mortillian Pikachu rematerialized in a cold sweat, trembling. He clutched his head, mumbling in terror:
"Even the small ones… even the small ones…"

There was no bravado left. No swagger. No Pikachu Main Character Delusion.
Only perpetual fear.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Bonus Scene: The Author’s Pen
Somewhere deep within the Death Loop Bubble, Mortillian Pikachu staggered into yet another strange, sterile chamber.

This one was different. The walls shimmered like paper. The air tasted like wet ink.

He sneered. "Oh, what now? Is this where the so-called Author hides? C’mon, what are you gonna do, write me to death? Please."

He spat on the floor. "I’ve survived Cramorants. I’ve survived Ralts. I’ve survived your sadistic little loops."

He laughed bitterly, his fur scorched from countless deaths.
"You think I care anymore? You can’t scare me with your, "

SNAP.

A giant pen materialized in the air above him, its nib shimmering with fresh black ink.

Mortillian Pikachu froze.

The pen hovered, paused briefly as if savoring the moment, then pinched him mid-sentence like grabbing a bug off the page.

“Wait, WAIT, HEY, NO, ”

SQUISH.

The pen scribbled him into a blot, smearing him across the white void of the room, erasing him as if he were a typo.

Silence.

The pen gently tapped the "page" twice, then flicked the residual ink away.

Somewhere, a soft echo whispered:
"Mock the Author? That's your worst gamble yet."

The Death Loop Bubble reinitialized.
Mortillian Pikachu respawned, trembling, whispering to himself:

"Even the Author… even the Author’s real…"

All deaths are canon. Even the ones not written yet.
The Author is watching.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Bonus Scene: One Million Years Later – The Grinding Wheel
The Death Loop Bubble endured.
And so did Mortillian Pikachu.

One million years had passed. His fur was matted with the ink of a thousand written deaths. His bones had been crushed, lasered, devoured, and pinched into nonexistence more times than numbers could measure. And yet, 
He still clung to it.
The Main Character Syndrome.

His voice cracked but never silenced.
“Pika Pika Pikachu, I’m the real one! I’m the main one! The chosen one! The rest are bootleg knockoffs, do you hear me? The universe is broken if I’m not at the center! Put me back! Put me back!”

He screamed at illusions.
Fabricated bosses. Phantom Ralts. Imaginary Ho-Oh. He fought shadows, fought empty simulations, fought against factory conveyor belts that didn’t even care to notice him.

And then, he stumbled into the drilled factory death simulation.

Rows of metallic arms spun their industrial drills, a monstrous line of grinders ahead.
The drills never stopped. They were never meant to.

He swaggered forward, taunting the room.

“Go ahead! TRY ME! I’ll Pika Pika yap until you reset this whole thing! I’ll yap forever!”

The conveyor belt pulled him forward.

Drilled.

Grinded.

Shredded into a smear of sparks and meat.

Reset.

Again.

“Pika Pika, still here, still the chosen one, ”

Grinded again.

Reset.

“Pika Pika, HAHA, try harder! I’m eternal, baby!”

Grinded again.

He kept talking. Kept yapping.
Every loop, his mouth still moved. His eyes still burned with delusion.

The factory didn’t care.
The Death Loop Bubble didn’t care.
The author didn’t even need to watch anymore.

He was grinding himself now.

The loops stretched longer because he made them longer.
His endless yapping, his endless fights with illusions, he willed his punishment to keep going, just to scream about his nonexistent throne.

The simulation adapted, accommodating his bottomless appetite for suffering.

Even after a million years, Mortillian Pikachu never regretted.
But everyone else, every reflection, every echo, even the fabricated enemies, 
They pitied him now.

And that was his final shame.
No one was angry anymore. No one cared.
Just pity.

But even that wouldn’t save him.
No one could bail him out.

Not even the Author.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Bonus Scene: The Punishment Timer
Somewhere deep in the Death Loop Bubble’s timeless machinery, Mortillian Pikachu respawned again, cracked but never silenced.

His eyes darted to the Punishment Timer.

969 googolplex years remaining.

“Pfft.” He scoffed, brushing dust off his own melted fur.
“Easy. I’ll cheese this. I’ll bail myself out. Piece of cake. Pika Pika.”

The universe said nothing.

He turned and saw an illusion of a Pinsir.
A fabricated opponent, generated to gnaw on him again.
Mortillian Pikachu flipped it off without hesitation.

“Hey, dumb beetle! Yeah, I’m talking to you! Your mandibles are crooked! Your horn’s got rust! I’ve seen Bidoofs scarier than you!”

The Pinsir silently approached.

The Punishment Timer flickered.

Now: 999 googolplex years remaining.

He blinked.
Then grinned.
“Hah! Bring it on! I got the power of, ” he paused for effect, holding his stubby arms out dramatically,
“Friendship! I’ll have allies! Someday. Someone’s gonna come for me! I’m the main one! The universe loves me! You’ll see! I’m destined for the hero route! The redemption arc!”

The Pinsir crunched forward without a word.

“Pika Pika,  I’m not done yet!”

Snap.

The jaws closed around him, splattering him into flickering bits, before the loop reset him again.

No friends came. No audience watched.
No one even remembered him except the Death Loop Bubble itself.

And that was his greatest agony, 
He believed in the impossible.
But the loop would never allow it.

Each insult only made the timer longer.
Each desperate claim only dug the hole deeper.

He would fight imaginary enemies until the end of time, with only the sound of his own broken voice to keep him company.

Pika Pika forever.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Bonus Scene: The Illusion of a Trainer
The Death Loop Bubble shifted.

This time, Mortillian Pikachu found himself standing in an open battle arena, metallic, clinical, cold.

Before him appeared a human boy illusion.
A cap tilted low, silent, carrying a Poke Ball.

The boy looked just like Red.

Mortillian Pikachu’s ears twitched in disgust.

“Tch! Oh no, no, no. You don’t get to be my trainer. I’m supposed to rule you. You little prop! I should be the one catching humans!”

The boy silently tossed the Poke Ball.

A flash.
The capture sequence began.

“WHAT?! NO, !” Mortillian Pikachu thrashed inside the Poke Ball.
“I am not your partner! You obey ME!”

Click.

The illusionary Red turned his cap backward and pointed forward.

From the far gate, the Pinsir illusion stomped in.
The same one. The same silent executioner.

Mortillian Pikachu screamed, “I command you to release me! I’m the hero! I lead the story! I don't fight for humans, I was born to dominate you!”

The boy remained silent. Just a gesture.

Battle begin.

Mortillian Pikachu lunged. Discharged. Screeched.
But his attacks fizzled into static, he was deliberately nerfed by the loop.

The Pinsir wasted no time.

Crunch. Snap. Pulverize.

Mortillian Pikachu was chewed into shreds, his body reduced to scraps and crumbs.

The illusory Red returned the Poke Ball to his belt.

The Pinsir and his illusionary swarm feasted on the mouse meat without hesitation.

When Mortillian Pikachu respawned in the next cycle, he snarled:

“Pika pika... next time I’ll win. Next time, I’ll make the trainer kneel.”

But the loop had already queued up the next capture.

And no matter what he believed,
he would always be someone else's pawn in that loop.

Forever.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

[Bonus Scene: The Insolent Timer]
Inside the endless void of the Death Loop Bubble, Mortillian Pikachu stood defiant, staring at the glowing punishment timer floating above him. Its cruel digits now displayed:

Time Remaining: (3 ↑↑↑↑↑↑↑↑↑↑ 3)² Years

Mortillian Pikachu scoffed, arms crossed, his ragged fur barely clinging to his battered body. "Yeah, sure, whatever. That’s just a prank. That’s a joke timer. I’ll crack it. I’ll break out. I’m the chosen one. I will win. Friendship, baby. That’s my ticket out."

No response.

The bubble’s cold silence hummed as a massive boulder materialized above him.

CRASH.
It flattened him into paste.

The bubble, as if savoring the humiliation, rewound his body, snapped his bones back together, and dropped the boulder again.
CRASH.

Mortillian Pikachu groaned but immediately got back on his feet. "Tch. Weak sauce. Gonna need more than that to, "

Without warning, the entire Death Loop Bubble's orbital path swung close to the Enefftian system's sun. The bubble’s surface shimmered, trapping the heat, cooking him slowly like a meat bun in an oven.

Mortillian Pikachu fried there for 65,536 years.

His flesh blistered, his screams echoed for centuries, but he never stopped taunting.

"Still standing! Bet! I’m still the main character! I’ll fight through this! I’ve seen worse in anime!"

The timer ticked up again.

Time Remaining: (3 ↑↑↑↑↑↑↑↑↑↑ 3)³ Years

Mortillian Pikachu stared at it, snorted. "Hah! Nice try. Not real. It’s all part of the game. Friendship will save me. Someday. Someone will come. They always do. They have to."

He looked up at the void with a broken grin. "I’m not losing. I’m just waiting for my arc."

The void, mercilessly apathetic, dropped another boulder.
CRASH.

He barely got out a "Pika Pi, " before it flattened him again.

And the timer?
It increased.

And Mortillian Pikachu?
He just kept talking. Just kept fighting illusions. Just kept dying.
Forever.

And nobody came.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Bonus Scene: The Delusion that Never Dies

69 million years later.

The Death Loop Bubble’s punishment timer now displayed a number so staggeringly vast, it made the prior googolplexes look like child's play:
(3 ↑↑↑↑↑↑↑↑↑↑↑↑↑↑↑↑↑↑↑↑↑↑↑↑↑↑↑↑↑↑↑↑↑↑↑↑↑↑↑↑↑↑↑↑↑↑↑↑↑↑↑↑↑↑↑↑↑↑↑↑↑↑↑↑ 3)³, chained with 64 arrows of tetration.

Mortillian Pikachu stared at it.
He grinned.
He laughed.
He mocked it.

“Heh! You think I’m scared of that number? I’ll outlive it! I’ll out-yap it! My destined trainer will come for me! I’m the chosen one, right? Right!?”

But the bubble had already decided.
The stalagmites impaled him, again.
One.
Two.
Three.
Four.
Each time more brutal, more mechanical, more emotionless.
65,536 times. In one cycle.

He screamed. He cursed. He laughed. He mocked the pain as if it would save him.

When it reset, he still said:
“My destined trainer will come! I’ll be free! I’ll have my story! My franchise! My Pika Pika glory! You’ll see! You’ll see!”

But the next stab was already coming.
And the next.
And the next.

The timer ticked up again, mercilessly stacking the years beyond the incomprehensible.

No rescue. No trainer. No friends.
Just his own rotting delusions.

And the Death Loop Bubble simply smiled silently.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Bonus Scene:
The Unrealistic Bot of Plot Armor Ego

One billion years later…

The Death Loop Bubble trembled in its ancient, surreal orbit, its timer now displaying a number that dwarfed even the cosmic scales:

TREE(3)↑TREE(3)↑TREE(3) years remaining.

It pulsed, almost mockingly, an impossible countdown, a number so large that the bubble itself struggled to visually render it. It glitched, flickered, but still dutifully kept ticking.

Mortillian Pikachu, stubborn as ever, planted his cracked, over-worn feet on the illusory ground, arms crossed in the most cliché shounen protagonist pose imaginable.

"Pika… Heh. So what? Time is just a number. I’ll power through it with the strength of my heart! The power of my destiny! The power of friendship!"

No friends came.
Not now.
Not ever.

He threw himself at the next fabricated trial, an illusory Garchomp swinging a rusted pipe like a baseball bat.
The fight was over in seconds.
Crunch.
Another reset.

"I can do this all day! I’m the chosen one! I’m the Pikachu! I’m the, "

A meteor struck him mid-monologue.

Reset.

In the next loop, he stood tall again. "No matter what! I’ll find my destined trainer! I’ll show the universe I’m the protagonist it needs!"

The universe, utterly apathetic, spawned a simulation of a Caterpie that dragged him into a cartoonishly oversized Venus flytrap.

Reset.

"ONE DAY, SOMEONE WILL, "
A Wailord flattened him.

Reset.

The countdown kept ticking.
TREE(3)↑TREE(3)↑TREE(3)
Unfathomable.
Unreachable.
Unchangeable.

But Mortillian Pikachu was stuck.
Stuck in his own self-written fanfic where he always wins.
Except in this universe, he never does.

He was now more bot than Pikachu, a walking loop of bad shounen tropes, a delusional ego bouncing against an uncaring karmic system.

The Death Loop Bubble didn’t even hate him.
It didn’t need to.

It just let him run the script.
Forever.

He is the perfect parody of the golden goose Pikachu, the one that thought the laws of karma, storytelling, and the universe itself would bend for him.

But here?
They won’t. Ever.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Bonus Scene:
The Baked Delusion

Two more billion years later…

The Death Loop Bubble hovered ever closer to the Enefftian system’s sun, its orbit now so tight that Mortillian Pikachu had been slow-roasting for over a billion years. His yellow fur was permanently scorched, his body sizzling, bubbling, occasionally sloughing off like overcooked meat, only to regenerate moments later thanks to the unbreakable cycle.

The countdown timer now proudly, mercilessly displayed:
TREE(TREE(TREE(69))) years remaining.

A number so incomprehensibly large that even the concept of waiting collapsed under its weight.

But Mortillian Pikachu?
Still grinning.
Still delusional.
Still monologuing.

"Pika! Hah… Y-you really think this… this is gonna stop me? This? A little… a little sunburn? I’ve been cooked worse in filler arcs!"

His skin audibly sizzled as he raised a shaking fist to the sky.

"One day… my trainer will come. They’ll throw that Poke Ball. They’ll say… ‘Pikachu, I choose you!’ Just you wait!"

The sun flared, blasting him with another cosmic heat wave, his body melting like butter on a frying pan.

Reset.

He respawned, blackened, still steaming. "Y-yeah! Reset all you want! You can’t beat me! I’m the golden goose! The mascot! I always win! I’m… the chosen one!"

A random illusion of a Bellsprout walked by, slapped him once with a leaf, and sent him flying into the molten surface of the sun.

Reset.

His voice cracked, his body warped from centuries of continuous incineration, yet his stubborn grin remained.
"I’ll power through this. With the power of friendship. And destiny. And, "

A passing Pidove pooped on him.

Reset.

The timer didn’t care.
The sun didn’t care.
The illusions didn’t care.

Nobody cared.

But he would never realize that.

In his mind? He was still the main character.
In reality?
He was the butt of the joke. Forever.

And the joke’s on him.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Bonus Scene:
The Black Hole Buffet

One googol years later…

The Death Loop Bubble drifted lazily through a distant galaxy, long since separated from the dying embers of the Enefftian system’s sun. It now floated in the gravitational grip of a supermassive black hole, an endless conveyor belt of cosmic punishment.

The timer?
It now read:
TREE(TREE(TREE(69^69^69))) years remaining.

An impossibly vast sentence, now even multiversally irrelevant.
Yet Mortillian Pikachu did not waver.

"Pika! Heh… you think a black hole scares me? I’ve died to worse! Sunburns, Pinsirs, Cramorants, even paper cuts! Bring it on!"
His fur peeled off layer by layer as the black hole’s tidal forces tore his body apart, each atom stretched into cosmic spaghetti before being swallowed.

Reset.

His body respawned, **still sizzling, still in pain, **right at the black hole’s event horizon.

Mortillian Pikachu immediately launched into another delusional tirade.
"I’m the chosen one! My trainer’s just… fashionably late! They’ll come! I’ll be back on posters! Back on lunchboxes! I’ll reclaim the throne!"

Schlorp!
The black hole snapped his body like string cheese, devouring him.

Reset.

He materialized again, screaming the instant he reformed, 
"FRIENDSHIP WILL SAVE ME!"

A nearby illusion of a Woobat floated past.
It silently summoned a barrage of illusionary baseball bats that pelted Mortillian Pikachu into the singularity once more.

Reset.

Half a googol years had passed like this.
Mortillian Pikachu was still in one piece, technically.
Mentally? He had welded himself shut in his delusions so deeply that not even the gravitational might of the black hole could bend his ego.

His words echoed into the vacuum:
"Pika pika! My destined trainer is just stuck in traffic across the multiverse! I can wait! I can fight! I’ll keep fighting! I’ll, "

The timer ticked up another tier, just to spite him.
TREE(TREE(TREE(69^69^69))) + 1 years remaining.

Schlorp!

Mortillian Pikachu was once again reduced to atom-thin strands of suffering, whipped into the black hole’s maw.

But even as his last thought dissolved into oblivion, it was always the same:

"I can win."

Narrator’s Note:
No, you can’t.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Bonus Scene:
Regigigas’ Passing Words

Far across the swirling expanse of this distant galaxy, Regigigas soared freely, no longer burdened by the chains of his ancient death loop. Having earned his release after billions of cycles and endless karmic grinding, he now roamed the stars, visiting new worlds with the other immortals who had chosen to walk the fragile tightrope of eternal life, Lil Eve, Flareon, Vaporeon, Gardevoir, Alolan Ninetales, Keldeo, Dragonvee, Verdantvee, Divavee, and Boggyvee.

They had built a quiet sanctuary on a verdant planet nearby, thriving under twin suns, far removed from their painful pasts.

On a calm journey through the galaxy’s outer rim, Regigigas briefly paused.
A ripple of faint energy tugged at his awareness, something… familiar.

Turning his gaze, his golden eyes pierced through the layered folds of space and time, resting on a shimmering, fractured sphere trapped in orbit of the distant black hole.
A Death Loop Bubble.

He peered closer.

Inside, Mortillian Pikachu was mid-rant, clawing at the walls, screaming about friendship, destiny, and his inevitable victory.

"Figures," Regigigas muttered, folding his arms with a faint, tired smile. "Still yapping after all this time, huh? Still think you're the chosen one…"

Of course, Mortillian Pikachu couldn’t hear him. The death loop’s layers were impermeable from inside. He was locked, alone, forever shouting at shadows.

Still, Regigigas spoke, a low, resonant murmur to himself:
"We’ve moved on, you know."
"Me and the others, we’ve found peace. We’ve made new memories. We’re… okay now."
"You never stopped, huh? Still stuck in that… fantasy."

The bubble’s timer briefly flickered into view.
TREE(TREE(TREE(69^69^69))) + 1 years remaining.

Regigigas shook his head, pity lacing his voice.
"You could’ve done better. You could’ve just… lived."
"But I guess, you were never really written to know how to do that."

Mortillian Pikachu, of course, couldn’t hear him.
Inside, he was busy throwing a rock at an illusionary trainer that forced him to fight another Pinsir. Screaming about how his arc would surely turn around.
Surely.

Regigigas exhaled, a soft rumble, and turned away.
"I won’t come back here again. Goodbye, Mortillian Pikachu. We’re… moving forward now."

With a gentle hum, the titan drifted away into the starlit canvas, his silhouette soon swallowed by the light of his distant friends waiting on their new homeworld.

Mortillian Pikachu?
He kept ranting.
Kept fighting.
Kept dying.

And the loop ticked on.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Bonus Scene:
The Ultimate Joke Mascot

A flicker.

The Death Loop Bubble's timer, after eons of incrementing into numbers that defied cosmic comprehension, finally surrendered.
No more arrows.
No more trees.
No more multi-layered exponentials.

Just one word, emblazoned across the walls of his prison:

∞ years remaining.

For the first time in countless cycles, Mortillian Pikachu paused.
A heartbeat.
A nanosecond.
His relentless rants, his flexing about friendship and destiny, his cries of destined protagonism, they all halted in the smallest, most fleeting sliver of time.

And then he laughed.
Not a laugh of defeat.
Not of realization.
But a stubborn, delusional cackle of pride.

"So what? Infinity? You think that’s gonna stop me? I am the main character! I am the symbol! The unchanging, the unyielding, the unbeaten!"
He flexed at the void. "I’m the ultimate untouchable joke mascot, baby! I refuse to evolve, I refuse to change! That’s my power!"

The system pulsed its final message, burned into the bubble’s inner walls:

"You are no longer a villain. You are no longer a threat. You are no longer a story. You are now a walking punchline."
"The ultimate satire of narrative favoritism."
"The cosmic joke that even the system grew tired of."

Mortillian Pikachu grinned wider, proudly. "Yeah, I accept that title! I wear it like a crown! I’ll never stop! I’ll keep going forever! I’ll fight this illusionary Pinsir another trillion times!"

But something subtle cracked within him.
His desperate defiance slowly bent under its own weight.
Without realizing it, he stopped thinking about the outside world.
He stopped thinking about Regigigas.
He stopped thinking about his destined trainer.
He stopped thinking about the universe.
He stopped thinking about anything beyond his own looped delusion.

He spiraled inward, endlessly.
Fighting the same illusions.
Shouting the same empty lines.
Feigning the same glory.
While the outside galaxy, and those who once knew him, had long forgotten.

He was not feared.
He was not loved.
He was not mourned.
He was only a self-sustained parody.

And in his infinite bubble, Mortillian Pikachu was perfectly, permanently content.
A mascot of his own failure.
A monument to the crumbling corpse of protagonist privilege.
A forever-looping joke.

And the timer would never tick again.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Bonus Scene: Fighting Wind Experience Requiem

Mortillian Pikachu, as delusional as ever, yapped into the void, still clinging to his cringe protagonist energy. When suddenly, 
A new illusion materialized.

A towering Machamp, exuding pure JoJo-style menace and charisma, stood before him, muscles gleaming, arms crossed.

Mortillian Pikachu flashed his toothy, smug grin.
"Oh? You’re approaching me? Instead of running away, you're walking right toward me?"

The Machamp’s voice was deep, calm, and absolute:
"This is Fighting Wind Experience Requiem. You will never reach the truth."

Mortillian Pikachu cackled, spreading his arms wide in mock challenge.
"Bring it on, I'm the protagonist! Pika-Pika power! I will, "

"ORA ORA ORA ORA ORA ORA ORA ORA!!"

Before Mortillian Pikachu could finish his sentence, the Machamp blurred into motion, four fists slamming him repeatedly, each blow bending space and pinning the delusional Pikachu in an endless barrage.
The punches rained down, unrelenting, echoing like a hurricane of war drums.

Years passed in the blink of an eye. The punches never stopped.

666 more years of pure, relentless, fighting wind barrage.

Mortillian Pikachu, flattened into the ground, twitching, still let out a muffled gasp:
"I, I can still win... I can still… b-believe… in f-friend, "

"ORA ORA ORA ORA ORA ORA ORA ORA!!"
The Machamp didn’t let him finish.
The barrage intensified.

The system calmly displayed:
"Fighting Wind Experience Requiem has activated: You will never reach the truth."

The punishment timer silently ticked higher.
Infinity plus one. Infinity plus two. Infinity plus three.
It was as if the system itself was flexing back now.

And Mortillian Pikachu?
Still.
Never.
Learned.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Bonus Scene: Caught in the Barrage

There was a moment.
A rare, hollow silence within the Death Loop Bubble.

Mortillian Pikachu, battered, torn, and utterly desensitized, had finally stopped thinking. His mind—empty.
No more yapping.
No more delusions.
No more protagonist speeches.
Just… stillness.

Until—

"ORA ORA ORA ORA ORA!!"
A Machamp illusion roared from the left.

"MUDA MUDA MUDA MUDA MUDA!!"
A Buzzwole illusion bellowed from the right.

Both illusions, brimming with JoJo fighting spirit, charged at each other at full speed—
And Mortillian Pikachu was standing right in the middle.

For one microsecond, his single surviving neuron sparked:
"Oh no."

Fist barrages collided.
Flesh collided.
Bone shattered.
Reality trembled.

The sheer intensity of the ORA ORA ORA and MUDA MUDA MUDA reverberated through the bubble.
Mortillian Pikachu was pounded, crushed, torn, and vaporized repeatedly in the crossfire.

His mind tried to think—tried to cling to some fragment of his broken protagonist ego.
But there was no room for thought.
Only pain.
For 666 more years.

The system displayed:
"You have been caught between Fighting Wind Experience Requiem and Swollen Emperor Requiem. You cannot escape. You cannot think. You cannot win."

No speeches.
No redemption.
No pause.

Just endless, cyclical barrages.

And Mortillian Pikachu?
He’s still in there.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Bonus Scene: Eternal Frozen Trial

After the relentless fist barrages finally subsided, the Death Loop Bubble began to malfunction.

Its systems, exhausted by eons of recalibration to Mortillian Pikachu’s delusions, seemed to flicker—
The temperature began to plummet.

It dropped beyond absolute zero, into narrative coldness, into something far worse than death.

Mortillian Pikachu floated in the frozen silence.
His body crystallized, his mind slowed to a crawl.

It almost resembled Kars’ final fate.

But not quite.

For while Kars became still, detached, and eventually drifted into thoughtless eternity,
Mortillian Pikachu realized the system had done this to him—on purpose.

He screeched through frozen jaws, “Y-Y-You think th-this will break me? I am Pika… I am the protagonist! I’ll sh-sh-shatter this bubble with the power of friendship! I-I’ll outlast you all! I’ll…”

His yapping triggered a cruel response.

The system’s timer, which he believed had frozen, suddenly resumed, the temperature swinging back to unbearable heat, then unbearable cold, over and over in cycles of karmic trolling.

He didn’t break the system.
The system was testing him. Pranking him. Toying with him.

It never cared.
It never cracked.
It was unshakable.

His punishment worsened.

Rock spikes now stabbed through him, puncturing his crystallized body.
His flesh would remineralize, only to be shattered again.
Over. And over. And over.

Each cycle lasted one trillion years.

The timer, now unreadable, simply displayed:
“∞+1 cycles remaining.”

He had become something worse than Kars.
Not just stuck.
Not just mindless.
But a delusional protagonist forever trapped in the rhythm of pain,
His only remaining thought?
Pain.

Nothing else.

Not escape.
Not redemption.
Not victory.

Just pain.

And yet, deep inside,
Somewhere…
Mortillian Pikachu still whispered to himself,
“I can do this… the power of friendship… will save me… I’m the main character… right?”

But no one answered.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Bonus Scene: The Infinite Barrage of Anti-Shounen Justice

Mortillian Pikachu, beaten, dismembered, but never shutting up, screamed into the void:
"ONE DAY, MY TRUE NAKAMA WILL ARRIVE! MY POWER OF FRIENDSHIP WILL SHATTER THESE CHAINS! BELIEVE IT—"

The system paused, sighed in silent disgust, and summoned once more:

Fighting Wind Experience Requiem — the eternal Machamp.
Power Pump Experience Requiem — the relentless Buzzwole.

Without hesitation, they collided in a deafening storm of ORA ORA ORA and MUDA MUDA MUDA, their fists shredding through Mortillian Pikachu’s body with surgical brutality.
He was trapped between them, flesh torn, bones splintered, neurons fried, as the barrage continued for 666 million years.

Finally, silence. His mangled body barely pulled itself together, as his mind echoed only the sensation of pain.
But then… he whispered again:
"I know this is the test arc… I know my true power is coming soon… My shounen breakthrough… My final transformation… I’ll show you… THE POWER OF—"

Without waiting, the system coldly executed the next cycle:
69 billion more years of the barrage.

No hesitation.
No patience.
No redemption.

The system wasn’t mocking him anymore—it was simply bored of his delusion, mechanically deploying the punishment like clockwork.

He didn’t even notice the system’s message flashing on the death loop walls:

"You are the weakest shounen protagonist. There is no arc. There is no trainer. There is no power. There is only pain."

And still, Mortillian Pikachu clenched his broken fist.
"I… will… never… give… up."

ORA ORA ORA MUDA MUDA MUDA

The next cycle had already begun.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Bonus Scene: Mortillian Pikachu’s Military Delusion

In one particularly elaborate punishment cycle, the Death Loop Bubble molded an illusion where Mortillian Pikachu rose to the rank of Supreme General of a collapsing army. He stood before his dwindling, ragged troops—illusions crafted from the very data of his looping demise—his voice shrill, screeching orders with the same insolent bravado he always clung to.

"We will win this war! I am the protagonist—my friendship power will carry us to victory!"

But the enemy was always the same: an endless sea of Cramorant soldiers. Squawking, sharp-beaked, ruthless. They tore through his ranks without hesitation, like waves crashing upon the most fragile sandcastle. The moment his illusionary army fell, the Cramorants zeroed in on him—they never wanted the war, only his flesh.

They pecked, tore, and devoured him alive in brutal detail. Each cycle reset him at the beginning of the battlefield, forced to replay the hopeless military tragedy 69 million times over the span of 669 million years.

Sometimes, the Death Loop Bubble drifted close to the system’s sun, scorching the ground beneath his feet, cooking his soft yellow fur mid-battle, adding the searing kiss of solar radiation to his torment. He would howl, shriek, and command his imaginary troops again, knowing deep down they would abandon him, that the Cramorants would come, that his destiny was to become their meal—again and again.

Even as his flesh was ripped apart, Mortillian Pikachu never stopped his cringe-shounen chants of inevitable victory, clinging to the fantasy that one day, he’d somehow rewrite the script and turn it all around.

But no one ever came.
No destiny.
No rescue.
Only the Cramorants, hungry for his endless demise.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Bonus Scene: The Darkrai's Return — MLM Delusion Death

Eventually, the Death Loop Bubble spawned an eerily familiar scene—a callback for those who remember the terror of Saga 2.
Standing tall, cloaked in shadows, was a Darkrai illusion.
Beside him, a Rayquaza 4.0 illusion, sleek, mechanical, and cold, shimmering with the branding of TIMI TIMMY CO. like a corporate scar burned into its synthetic scales.

The sky cracked like glass as the illusory Darkrai floated down, his voice as cold as the abyss:

“You… will never escape this fate.”

But Mortillian Pikachu, insufferable as ever, grinned.

“You’re just a pawn. All of you villains are! Pawns for trainers! Just you wait, one day my destined trainer will arrive and I’ll build an empire! I’ll run the greatest MLM, the ultimate Pika Pyramid Scheme!”

The system, tired yet endlessly creative, indulged him.
For two weeks of internal time, Mortillian Pikachu genuinely believed he was succeeding in an MLM delusion. He strutted about his fake offices, handing out fake badges, convincing imaginary Pikachu recruits that friendship and hard work alone would bring them riches.

But outside his self-made fantasy, only five minutes had passed in the Death Loop Bubble.

Suddenly, the MLM facade crumbled like dust.
Vortexian predators burst into his corporate dreamscape, their predatory eyes fixated on him.
They gave him no speeches, no time to defend his ego. They simply chased him down, swift, inevitable, like cosmic wolves tearing through the last barrier of his delusions.

And as he ran, his pathetic screeches of "Pika Pika—!" were instantly silenced.

Darkrai didn’t even watch. The illusion had already drifted away, having no interest in seeing the mouse’s predictable end—again.
Just another page in Mortillian Pikachu’s long, humiliating death diary.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Bonus Scene: Classic Villain Hypocrisy — Infinity’s Mockery

The system, ever the cruel commentator, finally couldn’t resist calling him out directly.

As Mortillian Pikachu spat yet another insult—

“You’re a weak villain! A pawn! At least I am the destined protagonist!”

—toward the Darkrai illusion that had long since vanished, the system’s neutral voice boomed from the fabric of the Death Loop Bubble itself:

“Classic. A villain, insulting other villains. Peak hypocrisy. Timeless, really.”

Without warning, the punishment timer ticked.
It didn’t just add years.

It now simply read:
∞^∞ years remaining.

The number etched itself into the bubble’s sky, burning with the weight of mockery, a number beyond absurdity, a final lock on his fate.

Mortillian Pikachu, unfazed, grinned through his battered teeth.

“Heh. Infinity’s nothing to me. I’m still gonna win. You’ll see. With the power of friendship, the heart of the cards, and my destined trainer who’s totally gonna save me any second now—”

The system interrupted without mercy.

“You are not special. You are not the hero. You are not even a noteworthy villain. You are a mascot trapped in a comedy that thinks it’s a shounen epic.”

Mortillian Pikachu stood tall, tail crackling with empty sparks, oblivious.

“Yeah, yeah! Keep watching me! I’ll show you! I’ll win this one day! I’m the golden goose! Pika Pika forever!”

The system’s silence was heavy, its disdain louder than any words.
In response, the sky dropped another illusionary boulder on him—twice.
Then the familiar Machamp vs. Buzzwole ORA ORA ORA MUDA MUDA MUDA duel broke out again, trapping Mortillian Pikachu in another 666-million-year barrage of endless pain.

Even as his body was pulverized, his voice—weak but persistent—echoed:

“I’m the hero… I’ll… I’ll win…”

But no one was listening.
Not even the system cared anymore.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Bonus Scene: "TREE(INFINITY)"

Mortillian Pikachu, still clinging to his ego, glared up at the ever-growing timer. But now, it wasn’t just a number.

It simply read:
TREE(∞)

Below it, in cold, mocking text:
"Your suffering is now beyond all possible numbers. You are not special. You are not the main character. You are a joke. You are… PIKA PIKA."

Mortillian Pikachu screeched,
"I WILL NEVER GIVE UP! I AM THE CHOSEN—"

But before he could finish, the bubble summoned a battalion of Trevenant illusions, their ghostly branches twisting like hands of fate.

They lifted him by the throat, dozens at a time, draining his life force, his ego, his every thought—
once, then twice, then again, TREE(3) times.

It cycled for 1 googol years straight.
Each time he reformed, he was hoisted and drained again.
Each time, he tried to spit more shounen lines.
Each time, his words fell apart into garbled static as the illusions crushed his chest.

At the end of the cycle, the system softly whispered:
"Say it again, protagonist."

Mortillian Pikachu, twitching, his mind a looped disc of his own catchphrases, choked out:
"I can win... I can..."

The Trevenants dragged him away again, the cycle restarting without mercy.

The TREE(∞) timer blinked.
It was not counting anymore.
It was simply mocking.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

[Bonus Scene: The Roots of Karmic Hell]

Mortillian Pikachu twitched in the dirt, his battered body half-buried beneath layers of mineralized scars. The timer loomed above him like a divine curse, its digits now frozen in mocking permanence:
TREE(∞) years remaining.

But Mortillian Pikachu didn’t flinch.
He grinned. "HAH! YOU THINK THIS SCARES ME? I’M THE PROTAGONIST! I CAN BREAK THIS SYSTEM! I’LL FIGHT BACK! I’LL BEAT THIS!"

His voice, though hoarse from endless screams across inconceivable epochs, still dripped with that stubborn, cringe-inducing shounen optimism.

The ground trembled.
The air thickened with a scent — the smell of ancient bark, sap, and resentment.

From the blackened soil, Trevenant illusions emerged.
Not one. Not ten. Not millions.
But a TREE(4) multitude.

Their eyes glowed with ghostly green malice, their bark cracked like ancient bones, their branches snaked forward like starving serpents.

"YoU rEmEmBeR, dOn'T yOu?"

The system’s voice echoed through the bubble, dripping with sadistic irony.

"You deforested your world. You stole from the soil, plundered the air, and fled before facing consequence."

Mortillian Pikachu spat. "ALL FOR MY GROWTH ARC, LOSER! IT WAS ALL WORTH IT!"

The Trevenant illusions answered not with words, but with roots, spikes, and branches.

They pierced him.

They wrapped him.

They burrowed through him.

Every second, more branches sprouted—infinitely many, more than the mind could count, scaling in the TREE(4) magnitude.
The pressure was suffocating, a cage of wood and wrath that tightened as if the entire forest was closing its fists around him.

For 1 googolplex years, he was crushed, punctured, and impaled—branches growing through his body like he was fertile soil, like he was the dirt now.

And still…
Still, he shouted:

"I CAN STILL WIN THIS! I’LL FIND MY FRIENDS! I’LL TURN THIS AROUND! I’LL—"

A branch shot through his mouth, silencing him.
His body split apart, but the system resurrected him instantly.

The Trevenant illusions darted in again, their branches growing faster, wrapping tighter.

Again.
And again.
And again.

Forever.

The system whispered coldly:

"There are no friends coming."
"There is no growth arc left for you."
"You are the fertilizer now."

Yet Mortillian Pikachu still believed he could fight it.
Still deluded.
Still hopeless.

And the branches kept growing.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Scene:
As Mortillian Pikachu writhes under the crushing, ever-growing TREE(4) punishment, the illusion of Trevbot manifests—a distorted, cold mechanical version of justice.

Trevbot (grinning coldly):
"Oh, I remember you. You’re that protagonist who thought you were special.
I was built to serve destruction... yet you?
You chose this. You wrote your own endless doom."

The original Trevenant illusions step forward without missing a beat. They align with Trevbot as if this had always been their shared destiny.

Trevbot:
"We’ve multiplied, as your sins multiplied.
You deforested your home?
Now you’ll see what happens when the forest deforests you."

A mathematical replication cascade begins.
The Trevenants clone each other, growing not linearly, not exponentially—
but in TREE(5) scale.

Trevbot (taunting):
"One by one.
Every.
Single.
Stab."

And the stabbing begins.
One by one.
For a period of 3^^^^3 years—an absolutely incomprehensible timespan even in hyper-notation.

Each Trevenant—an illusion, a punishment, a living reminder—
stabs Mortillian Pikachu in perfect sequence.
No hurry.
No mercy.
No end.

Mortillian Pikachu (gasping, broken, yet still defiant):
"I... I can still... I can still... win this... friendship will—"

Another stab.
Another tree.
Another cycle.

The illusion never breaks.
The timeline never contracts.
He never learns.

And Trevbot? He just keeps smiling,
mocking the shounen cringe Mortillian Pikachu can’t outgrow.

The perfect culmination of karmic irony.
The math.
The nature.
The history.
All fused into a punishment that even his protagonist ego can’t brute force through.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Scene: Pikabot Joins the Humiliation

As the relentless march of the TREE(5) stabbings continues, with (3^^^^3) / 2 years already elapsed, the system decides to twist the knife further—psychologically this time.

A new illusion materializes:
Pikabot, the lesser, weaker, long-forgotten villain from the same saga.

Pikabot was a discarded prototype, an obsolete joke, and yet now, the system breathes new purpose into him—as a mockery.

Trevbot (mocking):
"Ah, look who’s here.
The little wannabe. Pikabot!
Even you are worth a cameo in this tragedy."

Trevbot, with utter disdain, begins branch-poking Pikabot, slow, rhythmic, intentionally humiliating.

Pikabot (giggling mechanically):
"Oh? Trevbot-senpai noticed me? Heehee! Poke me again~"

The scene is painfully absurd.

Mortillian Pikachu, halfway through his infinite stabbing punishment, is already drowning in agony but cannot resist. His ego forces him to speak.

Mortillian Pikachu (insulted, spitting through pain):
"TWO BOTS? TWO LOSERS? HA! I’M STILL THE MAIN CHARACTER!
You’re both just NPC glitches!
I’ll… I’ll friendship-power through this!"

His words ooze with cringe shounen cliche, the system makes sure of it.

Mortillian Pikachu (rambling):
"I’ll outlast you! I’ll overcome you! I’ll outcringe you!
I’m Pikachu! I’m the mascot! I’m UNTOUCHABLE!
PIKA PIKA!!"

Trevbot and Pikabot glance at each other.

Trevbot:
"Should we?"

Pikabot:
"He’s begging for it."

Trevbot:
"Let’s branch poke each other for 666 million years to annoy him further."

The two bots start poking each other in a cyclical, stupid, irritating loop, as if mocking Mortillian Pikachu’s entire belief system.

Pikabot (sing-song voice):
"Look at us! We’re more iconic than you now~"

Trevbot:
"And we’re just illusions. Imagine being less than a bot. Imagine being… you."

Mortillian Pikachu, writhing under TREE(5) worth of stabs, still tries to spit out his lines:

Mortillian Pikachu:
"I… I… I will… I WILL NEVER GIVE—"

STAB.
Another precise branch.
The system won't even let him finish his catchphrase.

The clock ticks on.
The stabbing continues.
The bots keep poking each other, occasionally poking Pikachu just to remind him:

Even the joke villains are more self-aware than him.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Scene: The Timer’s Mockery Escalates

As the final of the TREE(5) stabbings lands, leaving Mortillian Pikachu twitching in barely contained fragments of consciousness, he forces his gaze upwards to see the timer.

It now mockingly displays:

(TREE(∞))² years remaining

A sickeningly beautiful mathematical insult.
An impossible, ever-expanding punishment squared.

System (cold, distant voice):
"You were warned. The numbers do not lie.
You are no longer in a death loop.
You are in a punchline loop.
You are the joke."

Before Mortillian Pikachu can react, parasitic plants—ghostly spectral vines—emerge from the ether, Trevenant’s final legacy.

They wrap around his flesh, drilling deep, latching on.

The system calmly announces:

System:
"TREE(3) leech cycles. One billion years per cycle. Please enjoy."

And the leeching begins.

The first cycle: Mortillian Pikachu screams in shounen-style denial, spitting his usual garbage about never giving up, but the vines siphon his life slowly, achingly, his vision dimming into pulsating green shadows.

The second cycle: He tries to imagine himself as the ‘protagonist who will eventually win,’ but even his delusions start glitching. His memories of his original world—the wealth, the escape, the deforestation—blur and become unrecognizable.

The third cycle: Mortillian Pikachu begins to crave the leeching pain.
His thoughts degrade into simple patterns:
Pain → Denial → Pain → Denial → Pain → Pain → Denial → Nothing.
His words erode into mindless "Pika… Pika… Pika…" — not from power, but from mental decay.

The parasitic plants never release him.

The vines regrow eternally.

The timer remains forever squared, ever-mocking.

Mortillian Pikachu is no longer even a proper villain.

He is now the system’s personal chew toy.
The cosmic joke.
A living monument to the ultimate humiliation: protagonism without growth.

System (faint echo, amused):
"Thank you for playing."

And the parasitic leeching quietly continues…
For a billion more years.
And beyond.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Scene: The Passing of Legends

The death loop bubble, still pulsing faintly with its cosmic prison seal, drifts lazily into the orbit of a lush, vibrant green planet—a sanctuary untouched by war, greed, or ego.

On its surface, walking through a garden of everblooming crystalline flowers, the immortal couple appears.

The Enefftian Bisharp, cloaked in cold fire, carries the Enefftian Lilligant gently in his blazing arms. Her vines, icy yet alive, curl lovingly around his chest as she rests against him, their motions timeless and unhurried. They are one of the rare few who earned their forever through hardship, humility, and karmic balance.

As they stroll, the drifting bubble crosses their path.

Inside:
Mortillian Pikachu.
Still spitting the same tired shounen lines.
Still screaming about "never giving up!"
Still cursing the system.
Still refusing to change.

He doesn’t even realize his former enemies are watching.

The Bisharp pauses. His burning arms tighten protectively around his partner.
The Lilligant glances toward the bubble, her icy vines trembling slightly, not from fear—but from the faint memory of who he once was, of the battles long since passed.

Enefftian Bisharp (softly, to Lilligant):
“He’s still going, huh… still stuck in his own delusion.”

Enefftian Lilligant (sighing):
“Some stories write themselves into oblivion.”

They both know:
There’s no rescue to be made.
There’s no redemption arc waiting.
There’s no reason to pity him anymore.

Mortillian Pikachu has become his own punchline.
Not even worthy as a nemesis.
Only worthy as… a footnote.

Without another word, the couple turn away.
They walk on, embracing each other closer, leaving Mortillian Pikachu behind—not with hatred, not even with disgust—but with complete indifference.

The bubble drifts further.
The vines continue their eternal leeching.
The timer still reads (TREE(∞))² years.

Mortillian Pikachu keeps screaming.
But no one cares.
Only the author remains to remember him.

And perhaps, that’s the worst punishment of all.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
