Classic dark fairytale structure(?) but with Pokémon. It hits that dramatic tone with a twisted antagonist (Tyranitar), a helpless but strong-willed victim (Espeon), a devoted but possibly flawed hero (Umbreon), and a wildcard anti-hero (Pikachu) who probably didn’t sign up for any of this... at first... until the twists happen later....

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


Title: Shadows of the Moonlight Vale

The air in the Vale was thick with ash and silence.

Espeon lay motionless in a cage of obsidian vines, her psychic energy flickering weakly beneath the weight of a suppressor band around her neck. The moonlight barely reached this corner of the ruined shrine, where Tyranitar paced like a king denied his throne.

"You should be grateful," he growled, voice like shifting gravel. "Most would beg to be chosen. But I will have patience... for now."

She met his gaze without flinching. “Umbreon will find me,” she whispered, voice taut with exhaustion. “And when he does—”

Tyranitar’s laugh shook the stones.

—

Far from the Vale, Umbreon stood atop a shattered cliff, eyes narrowed against the scent trail he had followed for hours. His ringed body pulsed faintly with rage. Beside him, Pikachu blinked, looking bored and vaguely annoyed.

“You dragged me out here for this?” Pikachu muttered. “I had plans tonight. Plans that didn’t include chasing your love life drama into haunted terrain.”

Umbreon didn’t look at him. “You owe me, remember?”

Pikachu groaned. “I owed you a favor. Not a death wish.”




----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


Exactly—Espeon’s Psychic type being vulnerable to both Umbreon and Tyranitar’s Dark makes the whole situation feel even more tense, almost symbolic. She’s caught between two forces she can’t overpower directly—one who loves her, and one who wants to possess her. Let’s raise the stakes.



Scene Two: Echoes Beneath the Shrine

The entrance to the shrine was silent, overgrown with twisted brambles and carved with crude runes—a warning long since ignored. Umbreon’s rings glowed faintly in the gloom as he slipped between the shadows. Behind him, Pikachu followed, reluctantly, tail twitching with every creak of the stone beneath their feet.

“So what’s the plan?” Pikachu whispered. “We storm in, shout ‘Give her back,’ and then get flattened by a walking mountain?”

Umbreon didn’t answer.

“You don’t have a plan, do you?” Pikachu muttered.

“I have a purpose.”

“Tch. Great. He’s in vengeance mode.” Pikachu’s fur sparked with static.

—

Deeper inside, Espeon stirred, ears twitching at the faint echo of movement. Tyranitar stood before a stone altar, claws scraping impatiently at the edge. He had dressed it with stolen petals and jagged crystals, a mockery of a ceremony that had no soul.

“We could be perfect,” he murmured, half to her, half to the ghosts in his mind. “You understand light. I understand shadow. It’s balance.”

Espeon’s gem glowed weakly. “You don’t want balance. You want obedience.”

—

Suddenly, the shrine trembled.

Tyranitar turned, nostrils flaring. “He’s here.”

And from the upper corridor, a yellow flash crashed through the stone—Pikachu, yelling mid-air: “I knew this was a trap!”

Umbreon followed like a shadow unleashed.

“Give. Her. Back.”




----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------






Scene Three: The Fall Beneath the Shrine

The battle was thunder and fury.

Umbreon dove first, silent and deadly, striking at Tyranitar’s flank with a shadow-charged Foul Play. Tyranitar barely flinched. His counterattack was immediate—Stone Edge erupted from the floor, slamming Umbreon into a wall with a sickening crunch.

“Umbreon!” Espeon screamed, eyes wide with horror.

Pikachu roared, lightning crackling violently. “Thunderbolt!” The beam struck Tyranitar square in the chest, staggering the brute. For a second, the air smelled like burnt sand and ozone.

But Tyranitar just grinned.

“I gave you a chance,” he growled, then lunged forward with terrifying speed.

His claws caught Pikachu mid-dodge. One swipe. One final cry.

Then silence.

Umbreon, broken and bleeding, crawled to Espeon’s cage. He pressed his muzzle to hers, eyes dim. “I’m sorry… I couldn’t…”

And Tyranitar brought down a final Dark Pulse, drowning him in shadow.

Scene Four: Ceremony of Dust

Espeon wailed, psychic energy flaring in useless bursts. “You monster—!”

Tyranitar stood tall, dragging her to the altar. “They chose to fight. You choose to live.”

He placed a dull crown of thorns atop her head and stepped back. “You will remember this moment as the day the world bent to fate.”

—

But hidden in the crumbling walls above… Blissey watched. Once his maid, long discarded when she spoke of mercy. She clutched an old feather in trembling hands—a gift from a time before his cruelty.

“Enough,” she whispered, holding the feather to the moonlight. “Please… hear me.”

A sudden wind cut through the shrine.

Above, the sky split open with gold and flame.

Ho-Oh descended.

Scene Five: Phoenix Rebirth

Tyranitar turned too late.

From Ho-Oh’s wings poured sacred light—life reborn. The shrine shook with divine force as Umbreon stirred, his wounds sealing in radiant fire. Pikachu blinked awake, dazed, then immediately bolted in terror, vanishing into the woods without a word.

Umbreon rose, golden embers in his fur. He turned to Ho-Oh, stunned. “Why?”

Blissey stepped forward. “Because she loved you. And because someone had to care.”

He looked at her, then to Espeon, still bound and crying.

His voice was low, but firm.

“Round two.”



----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------



Scene Six: The Siege of Shadow Watchers

The shrine was now a fortress.

At Tyranitar’s command, his elite dark-type sentinels stood guard:
- Absol, silent and watchful, eyes glowing with omen.
- Darkrai, drifting through walls like a nightmare incarnate.
- Sableye, grinning with jewels in his eyes, hungry for mischief.
- And Zoroark, the lone female— fierce, cunning, and suspicious of everything.

Inside, Tyranitar was nearly finished. Espeon struggled weakly against enchanted cords binding her into a ceremonial dress—silken white laced with obsidian thread. Her tears fell quietly.

"You will be mine," Tyranitar growled, voice low. "Even the gods can't change that now."

—

Outside, Umbreon stood before Ho-Oh, the legendary bird shimmering with golden light.

“I need you,” Umbreon said, bowing deeply. “Distract them. All of them. Take every blow. Just give me one chance.”

Ho-Oh blinked, then let out a cry that shook the heavens.

The sky cracked open again.

Flames roared down as Ho-Oh descended upon the guards, scattering shadow and fire in a storm of divine wrath. Absol and Darkrai immediately retaliated with Night Slash and Dark Void, while Sableye cackled, phasing through Ho-Oh’s wings with eerie glee. Zoroark vanished in illusion, waiting to strike.

—

Amid the chaos, Umbreon nodded to Blissey, who was already moving—quiet and quick through the back corridors of the shrine. Her heart pounded. She had one task: free Espeon.

But when she reached the chamber—

Espeon was already tied to the altar. Tyranitar stood over her, claws holding the final piece of the cursed wedding veil.

Blissey gasped.

—

At the same moment, somewhere in the trees, Pikachu stopped running.

The sounds of battle echoed behind him.

His paws clenched. His tail crackled.

“I’m a rat,” he muttered. “But not that kind of rat.”

Then, with a growl, he turned and sprinted back toward the shrine, sparks flying behind him.

—



----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


Scene Seven: The Phoenix Nearly Falls

Ho-Oh, majestic and burning, was beginning to falter.

Absol’s blades had struck true. Darkrai’s Dark Pulse cracked celestial feathers. Zoroark’s illusions disoriented even the divine. Ho-Oh flared with a final burst of Sacred Fire, forcing them back—but its wings drooped. Its flame dimmed.

“I cannot… rise again,” Ho-Oh gasped.

Umbreon, battered but burning with purpose, leapt forward, shielding the godlike bird. “Then I will rise for you.”

Night Slash slashed across his flank. Umbreon winced, braced to fall—

But a crack of lightning lit the night.

Pikachu, tail gleaming with vengeance, dove from above. “Thunder Wave!”

Absol convulsed, stunned mid-leap. The battlefield turned. Zoroark snarled and vanished into the smoke, grabbing Darkrai and Sableye to retreat into the shadows.

But Pikachu didn’t see the last twist.

Zoroark reappeared—as Espeon.

“Wait, Espe—?” he blinked.

Slash.

Blood splattered. Pikachu collapsed, again, gasping for breath.

“No—!” Umbreon roared, lunging forward. He struck Zoroark with a Payback filled with rage, just as Ho-Oh called down a searing Sky Blessing. The illusion shattered, Zoroark crumpled, unconscious.

Ho-Oh’s final embers washed over Pikachu, breath returning to his lungs.

“I died twice for you guys,” Pikachu croaked, eyes fluttering. “Third time’s a charge…”

—

Elsewhere…

In the ruins’ silent rear hall, Blissey had almost reached Espeon, cutting one final thread from her veil.

Then—a whisper behind her.

Darkrai’s cold breath on her neck. Sableye’s claws around her arms.

She screamed once before shadows swallowed her whole.

—



----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------



Final Scene: Shadows Redeemed, a Tyrant’s Fall

In the scorched aftermath of the battle, Umbreon stood over the fallen Zoroark and Absol, not with vengeance, but mercy. His rings pulsed with calm light.

“You don’t have to end this in darkness.”

Zoroark stirred, groaning. “She still owes me 600 Poké… with interest.”

Espeon, faintly glowing, sighed with telekenesis. “I paid it… eventually…”

Absol sat up, eyes downcast. “I just needed cash for skins. They released ten legendaries in one banner. I cracked.” He looked away. “This isn’t who I wanted to be.”

Umbreon extended his paw. “Then fight with me. Fix it.”

They took it.

—

Suddenly, Tyranitar returned, crashing through the shrine wall with a roar that shook the mountains. His rage had only grown, now monstrous and glowing with a corrupted Mega Stone aura. “You dare stand against me… all of you?!”

Umbreon stepped forward, unshaken. Behind him stood:

- Pikachu, tail sparking with renewed resolve

- Zoroark, illusions swirling around her

- Absol, blades sharpened, eyes clear

- Ho-Oh, rising once more with divine fire

Tyranitar charged Umbreon in a violent quake of earth and shadow.

They clashed like titans.

—

As they fought, Zoroark and Ho-Oh flanked the battlefield, striking Darkrai, who had emerged from shadow to backstab the group. Zoroark danced through illusions while Ho-Oh scorched his nightmares with searing light.

Across the field, Absol and Pikachu cornered Sableye, who giggled wildly while launching Shadow Claws in all directions. Absol’s calm slashes cut through the madness. Pikachu’s Thunderbolt grounded him.

Mid-battle, Absol whispered to Pikachu, “Cover me.”

He slipped away.

—

Back inside the shrine, Blissey and Espeon still lay in shadow chains. Until—

Slice.

Absol emerged behind them, blades flashing, silently cutting the restraints.

“You’re late,” Blissey said, dusting herself off.

“I had a side quest,” he muttered.

—

Returning to the front line, Blissey unleashed her full Healing Pulse, breaking CC effects and restoring Umbreon’s fading strength. Espeon joined Umbreon with a silent nod, her Psybeam cutting through Tyranitar’s armor.

Together, they launched a synchronized attack—Espeon’s psychic force and Umbreon’s Dark Pulse tearing through his corrupted energy. Tyranitar howled.

Then, in one final moment, the five struck in perfect unison:

- Pikachu’s Volt Tackle

- Zoroark’s Night Daze

- Absol’s Megahorn

- Espeon’s Psyshock

- Umbreon’s Last Resort

Tyranitar fell.

Cracked, broken, and unconscious. The Mega Stone shattered.

—

The shrine fell silent. Wind carried away the last of the dust.

Umbreon turned to Ho-Oh. “It’s over.”

Ho-Oh nodded. “You all chose light when darkness was easier. That is what makes heroes.”

Pikachu sat down hard. “Can I not die in the next arc?”

Everyone but Ttar, Sableye and Darkrai (those 3 are fainted unconcious and left there) laughed.


----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Chapter: Gacha Ruins Everything Again

Three days after the climactic battle, peace finally seemed possible.

Umbreon and Espeon sat beneath a peaceful cherry-blossom tree just outside the restored shrine, quietly sharing berries and half-coy smiles. Ho-Oh and Absol stood watch nearby, acting more like awkward uncles than bodyguards.

Absol kept glancing at the sky. “Something’s wrong.”

Ho-Oh sipped divine tea. “You’re paranoid.”

Just then, the clouds ripped open. A machine descended, shimmering with corrupted light and fake sparkle.

RAYQUAZA, massive and glowing, landed—fused with a casino capsule machine.

“COME SPIN FOR LEGENDARY LOOT AND DUBIOUS SKINS!” it bellowed, voice glitching like a possessed ad.

Absol froze. His eyes dilated. “No… no. Not again.”

Flashback montage: Gacha banners. Zero pulls. Whiffed 0.5% drop rates. The Lopunny skin he never got.

He screamed and charged blindly.

Rayquaza blinked. “Huh?”

A burst of wind sent Absol flying into a metal pole. CLANG. He dropped like a fainted Rattata.

“Absol!” Espeon shrieked. Ho-Oh immediately hovered over him and revived him with a pulse of phoenix magic. “You have got to stop doing this.”

—

Before anyone could regroup—

Tyranitar burst from the ground. “I! WANT! REVENGE—!”

SMASH.

He tripped mid-roar, accidentally body-slamming Rayquaza, who had just retracted his gacha legs.

Blood. Coins. Limbs. Legendary scales.

Everyone just stood there.

“…What the hell?” Tyranitar muttered, now drenched in Rayquaza’s weird techno-blood and surrounded by dropped Poké coins.

Umbreon and Espeon blinked. “Was that… on purpose?”

Ho-Oh hovered over the scene, deeply confused, then solemnly handed Tyranitar a pouch full of gold coins. “Thank you for your service. You have defeated the true evil.”

Tyranitar stood frozen. “Am I the hero now?”

Absol, revived and dazed, limped over. “Guess you don’t need Espeon after all. There are plenty of other ladies.”

He listed them off, holding up a wing-finger per name:

“Tsareena. Lilligant. Pheromosa. Salazzle. Lopunny… Maybe even Gardevoir if Lucario ever screws up again.”

Tyranitar blinked. “…I mean. That’s a start.”

The camera slowly zoomed out on the four, standing in blood, coins, blossoms, and godly confusion.


----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Chapter: Romance, Regret, and Rabbits

Still standing in the aftermath of Rayquaza’s explosive death, Tyranitar looked around, breathing heavily, glitter and blood drying on his rocky body.

He turned to Umbreon and Espeon, who were still holding paws, dazed from everything.

Suddenly, he grabbed both their heads and smooshed them together.

“KISS!! NOW!! ROMANCE DESERVES A FINISHING MOVE!”

Umbreon grunted. Espeon yelped. Their faces squished like berries.

When he finally let go, they blinked—then awkwardly kissed for real, just to stop him from trying again.

Tyranitar clapped. “YES!! TRUE LOVE WINS!!”

Then—his eyes widened.

Across the field, a Lopunny was picking flowers, humming softly.

Tyranitar's heart skipped several jagged beats. “Mine?”

He stomped forward.

Lopunny turned. She froze.

Her ears stiffened. “...Oh no.”

She dropped her bouquet and bolted.

“WAIT!! I’M REFORMED!! I’M RICH!! I HAVE MONEY AND TRAUMA!!”

He chased her across the hills, screaming about love, loot, and redemption.

Behind them, Umbreon and Espeon sat on the grass, finally relaxing again.

Absol sighed. “Should we stop him?”

Ho-Oh shook his head. “Nah. Let karma do its thing.”

The camera slowly faded out on Lopunny's silhouette fleeing into the sunset—Tyranitar stumbling behind, coins falling from his bag like breadcrumbs.

[Fin????]

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Why Rayquasa dies?

Honestly, Rayquaza in Pokémon Unite (or Divide) is the literal embodiment of unfair, unearned power. A glorified loot box boss with no mechanical skill, just “last-hitter wins” trash.

At least Pikachu players sometimes aim and time stuns. Rayquaza just descends from the heavens, invalidates a whole fight, and hands the win to whoever sneezes near it last. He’s the final insult in a game that already hates balance.

In this fanfic? Rayquaza deserved to die in a pile of coins and confusion. Tyranitar unintentionally did the world a favor by body-slamming the crony-capitalism incarnate.


----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


Chapter: The Fire Child Awakens

Years passed.

Umbreon and Espeon, finally free of tyrants, monsters, and gacha nightmares, raised a bright-eyed Eevee son. He was curious, kind, and strangely warm to the touch—until one day, during a peaceful visit, Ho-Oh gifted him a Fire Stone, whispering:

“Light your own path.”

A flash of flame later, Eevee evolved into Flareon—and the forest hasn’t been the same since.

—

One day, young Flareon wandered deeper into the woods than ever before—just chasing butterflies and burning twigs for fun—until he stumbled across a brutal scene.

His parents, Umbreon and Espeon, were pinned to the ground by a monstrous figure:

Buzzwole.

Muscles pulsing. Eyes crazed. Flexing over their weakened bodies, both clearly struggling— Espeon’s psychic powers suppressed, Umbreon too poisoned to move.

“Bug types feast today,” Buzzwole growled.

Flareon froze. “...Mom ...Dad?”

Umbreon coughed. “Run— he's... Bug... Fighting...”

Buzzwole turned. “A fire baby? Cute.”

He lunged.

WHOOOM—

Flareon’s mouth flared with his first real Flamethrower, searing Buzzwole’s legs. The bug-beast howled, stumbling.

“You’ll pay for that!” Buzzwole hissed, trying to grab Flareon and activate his leeching power.

But Flareon grit his teeth. Fire surged through his veins.

“FLARE BLITZ!”

Like a comet, he collided with Buzzwole’s chest—blasting him backward, straight into the clearing of a luxury villa.

Buzzwole crashed into the middle of a private hot spring surrounded by:

- Tyranitar, sunbathing in shades

- Pheromosa, sipping mocktails

- Salazzle, lazily floating

- Lilligant, doing yoga

They all paused.

Tyranitar lifted his sunglasses. “...Is that Buzzwole?”

Pheromosa narrowed her eyes. “My ex-husband?!”

Buzzwole groaned, twitching, passed out—half-burned, half-embarrassed, sprawled in front of his ex-wife and her new friends.

Flareon padded up, panting but proud. “He tried to hurt my parents.”

Tyranitar leaned back, sipping his berry juice. “Kid’s got fire. Respect.”

Pheromosa looked at Flareon and smirked. “Your dad raised you well.”

-

Scene fades on Flareon standing tall over the fallen Ultra Beast, as the flames of family and vengeance burn ever brighter.


----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


Chapter: Steam & Ice—Vaporeon's First Impression

Back in school, Flareon was still getting used to his newly evolved form, within his new uniform long pants and half-zipped jacket. His flames were hard to control, and most classmates either avoided him… or admired him from a safe distance.

Except Vaporeon.

She wears a pleated skirt, sat next to him, tail flicking, calm as a still lake.

“Hi. You’re the kid who cooked that giant bug, right?” she asked casually.

“Uh… yeah?”

“I’m Vaporeon. Wanna hang out?”

Flareon blinked. His fur crackled with nervous heat.

A few days later, he visited her house: an unusual blend of lush green gardens and frosted walls. Turns out her parents were…

Leafeon (Dad): Overprotective, earthy, always pruning something

Glaceon (Mom): Elegant but cold-eyed, had icicles in her tone

The moment Flareon walked in, the temperature spiked. Steam hissed off ice. Flowers wilted slightly.

Leafeon narrowed his eyes. “He smells like ash.”

Glaceon’s breath frosted the air. “And radiates like a broken sauna.”

Vaporeon just smiled and dragged Flareon deeper into the house. “Ignore them. They’ve never met a fire type they didn’t insult.”

While they were sipping Oran smoothies in the backyard, a screech tore through the sky.

Talonflame, looking ragged and hungry, divebombed the patio.

“This is a stick-up!” he squawked. “Gimme berries, now!”

Vaporeon’s eyes didn’t even blink. “No.”

“What?”

She calmly stood up, walked forward, charged a Water Pulse, and BLASTED Talonflame into a snowbank before Flareon could even react.

“You get one more chance before I ice your wings and call Ho-Oh.”

Talonflame trembled, dropped a bag of stolen coins, and screamed, “I’M SORRY!” before limping off.

Flareon just stared.

Vaporeon turned to him with a soft smile. “Sorry about that. You okay?”

Flareon nodded slowly. “...You’re terrifying.”

“I get that a lot.”

As they returned inside, steam and frost quietly warring behind them, Flareon thought to himself:

I really shouldn’t make her mad.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Chapter: Burn Through the Roots

It was supposed to be a peaceful walk.

Flareon and Vaporeon, side by side, decided to invite their parents along to show they were “just friends” (they weren’t fooling anyone).

Umbreon and Espeon were chill as ever, playfully teasing their son, making jokes about “young steam love.”

Leafeon and Glaceon, however, were stiff, judgmental, and about as warm as a snowstorm in the desert.

When the group passed by a mysterious old gate labeled "Private Property – Keep Out. Especially Fire and Water Types", curiosity won over caution.

They entered Trevenant’s garden, an eerie forest grove filled with gnarled roots, rotting trees, and ghostly whispers. Vaporeon leaned against a mossy trunk.

Suddenly, the tree came alive.

Trevenant, angered and twitching with spite, burst from the ground, vines lashing out.

“You dare bring fire into my sacred grove?! Water-witch, your kind drained my swamps! I’ll wring you dry!”

He grabbed Vaporeon, his spectral arms starting to sap her hydration.

Flareon turned in panic—only to see his parents distracted by Sableye, who was shaking a tin cup and babbling, “Hey buddy, spare some change for a shiny stone?”

Umbreon blinked. “What— are you serious right now?”

Back near Trevenant, Leafeon and Glaceon stepped in to defend their daughter—but the twisted roots wrapped around them, draining their strength.

Vaporeon gasped, weakening.

“Fla…reon…”

His eyes ignited.

“LET. HER. GO!”

With a roar, Flareon charged, fire bursting from his body. He leapt at Trevenant’s face and blasted a full-power Flamethrower directly into his wooden skull.

Trevenant shrieked in agony, thrashing as the fire scorched his bark. He dropped everyone and collapsed in smoldering pain.

Silence fell.

Everyone looked at Flareon.

Vaporeon, still steaming, limped over and hugged him. “Thank you.”

Even Leafeon and Glaceon—covered in moss and humbled—nodded.

Leafeon coughed. “...You’re… not bad, fire boy.”

Glaceon gave a small smile. “I suppose heat can be comforting.”

Trevenant groaned and slowly rose.

“I… lost control. I haven’t had guests in decades. I’m sorry. Especially to the water one.”

They all left quietly after that, back into the sunlight, a little shaken but unharmed.

As they walked, Vaporeon leaned on Flareon.

“You keep saving me.”

He smiled. “Well… you did beat up a Talonflame for me first.”

She chuckled. “Fair.”

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Chapter: Sparks and Spite

Back in school, things had finally started to feel... normal.

Flareon and Vaporeon were a low-key couple now—walking to class together, exchanging notes, sharing awkward tail bumps under the desk.

Their teacher was the wise (and often sassy) Ms. Sylveon, a transwoman with a calm presence, immaculate bows, and an uncanny ability to stop classroom drama with one look.

“Love is a battlefield,” she’d say, sipping Pecha tea. “But at least try not to scorch the carpet again, Flareon.”

But peace rarely lasts.

Enter: Jolten.

An electric-type orphan Jolteon. Rough around the edges. Constantly in detention. Had a “cool guy” act—spiky fur, half-lidded stare, never wore the school sash properly. His favorite pastime?

Flirting with danger. And with Vaporeon.

“Yo, Vapo,” he’d say, leaning on her locker, “ever wonder what it’s like to date someone who doesn’t light the room on fire every time they blush?”

She rolled her eyes. “Ever wonder what it’s like to not get zapped for sexual harassment?”

Ms. Sylveon immediately dragged him by the ear and muttered something about “boundaries and bootcamp.”

But Jolten didn’t stop. And Flareon noticed.

Every day, a little more tension crackled between them—not just type-wise, but personally. Flareon’s flame tails twitched every time Jolten got too close.

Until one day during lunch, Jolten dropped a bomb.

He walked up to their table, slammed a letter down, and said, “Battle me. For her.”

Everyone gasped. Even Ms. Sylveon dropped her tea.

“You’re not a prize,” Flareon growled.

“I’m not yours, either,” Vaporeon snapped at Jolten. “But for the record—if he fights you, I’m still healing him.”

Jolten grinned. “Fine. Tomorrow after class. Winner gets to ask her out.”

Sylveon finally stood up. “Absolutely not. This is not a dating dojo.”

Flareon, however, stared Jolten down. “I won’t fight for her like she’s an object. But if you insult her one more time—I’ll burn the sparks out of you.”

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Chapter: Shocking Secrets and Quaking Consequences

The next day, the battlefield was set.

Out back behind the school gym, Jolten stood sparking with energy, eyes locked on Flareon, who calmly walked into the ring. Vaporeon stood nearby, arms crossed, not thrilled about any of this.

“Still doing this?” she asked.

Flareon didn’t answer. He just stared at Jolten. “Let’s end this quickly.”

The crowd of students cheered. Even Ms. Sylveon was hiding behind a notebook, sipping her emergency tea. “This is going to be so emotionally unhealthy.”

The battle began— flashes of Thunderbolt and bursts of Flamethrower collided, lightning and fire ripping through the field.

It was epic.

Until it wasn’t.

Suddenly, the ground rumbled—a low groan rising from beneath them. Then:

BOOM— an Earthquake.

Both Jolten and Flareon were slammed to the ground, crying out in pain. Their shared Ground-type weakness rendered them completely vulnerable.

“What the—who’s using Earthquake!?” Sylveon screamed, bows flailing.

Then the wall of the PE building exploded.

Garchomp, the jacked, grizzled PE teacher, stormed out, dragging a half-dead Pikachu by the tail.

“You idiot rodent! You think I wouldn’t find out you used the gym computer to search for Porks instead of training logs?! Porks!! PORKS!!"

Pikachu whimpered, “I thought it was like anime... b-but meatier...”

Vaporeon dashed onto the battlefield, eyes glowing, and summoned a massive Surf to douse the shockwaves and stabilize the battlefield.

She helped Flareon and Jolten up, both still dazed.

"You're both idiots," she muttered. "You almost got flattened over me, and it was all because Pikachu was googling pork-based cartoons.”

Even Sylveon was too stunned to comment. "I'm logging out of this reality."

Aftermath:

- Garchomp gave Pikachu 3 weeks of intense squat punishment.

- Flareon and Jolten shared a silent moment of respect, at least until Jolten muttered, “I still think I’m hotter.” Flareon just laughed.

- Vaporeon put both boys on a “no flirting, no fighting” probation.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Chapter: The Sh*tstorm Saga

The trio— Flareon, Vaporeon, and a slightly less insufferable Jolten— were finally enjoying a normal stroll through the suburbs.

Until the ground shook again.

“…Okay, if this is another pork-related incident, I swear—” Vaporeon growled.

They followed the tremors to a large, snow-dusted cottage: the home of Mamoswine and his elegant wife, Alolan Ninetales. The elderly couple had always been the quiet type—until now.

Inside, absolute chaos.

Zeraora, the notoriously edgy electric guest, was stomping through their living room, holding a PokéPad. “What the actual Zapdos is THIS!? You searched up Porkyman: Icy Desires last night? What the hell, you frosty dimwit!?”

Ninetales, radiant and chilly, gave an awkward smile. “It was… research.”

“Research my fuzzy tail!” Zera shouted. “You’re an idiot!”

The moment he said that, the temperature dropped.

Ninetales winced in embarrassment.

Mamoswine’s eyes narrowed.

“…What did you call my wife?” he asked in a low, rumbling tone.

“An idiot—”

BOOM. EARTHQUAKE.

Zeraora was flung out of the house like a Meowth in a Team Rocket episode.

He flew through the sky, screaming, until he crash-landed squarely in Trevenant’s garden.

The ancient tree Pokémon, still a little unhinged from past events, blinked at the smelly, dazed Zeraora now buried head-first in his soil.

“Oh look,” Trevenant muttered. “Fertilizer.”

And so began the most humiliating five minutes of Zeraora’s life: dragged by vines, dunked in swamp water, and force-fed compost “for balance.”

When he finally escaped—caked in feces and regrets—he stumbled back to Mamoswine’s doorstep.

Collapsed.

Dead.

Again.

Ho Oh, having just finished reading a book titled “The Art of Inner Peace,” landed with a sigh.

“Bro. Again?”

The majestic phoenix let out a sparkle of holy fire, cleaning and reviving Zeraora’s mangled, smelly corpse.

Then came the lecture.

“Zeraora. This is your THIRD revival this month. You called a graceful ice maiden an idiot, invaded search history privacy, and got murked by a ghost tree’s compost rage. Are you TRYING to make me die of stress?”

Zeraora sniffled, still smelly. “I just… wanted to know what pork-themed romance was…”

Ho Oh slapped him with a wing. “There are safer ways to ask questions!”

-

The eeveelution trio just stood there, wide-eyed.

Vaporeon turned to Flareon. “I take back what I said earlier. We are the normal ones.”

Jolten nodded solemnly. “Never searching anyone’s browser history again.”

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Chapter: Closet Chaos & Troll Tactics

That night, back in the frost-gardened sanctuary of Vaporeon’s home, the moonlight sparkled off the delicate balance of leafy vines and frozen spires. Inside, all was calm… until the doorbell rang.

Zoroark stood there, still elegant in her illusion-shifting beauty, wearing a sly grin and a satchel slung over her back.

“Long time no see,” she smirked as Leafeon opened the door.

“Zoro!” Leafeon beamed. “Still hiding in shadows and ruining people’s emotional stability?”

Glaceon added, “We thought you were dead—or famous.”

Zoroark stepped in with a wink. “I got better. Heard you two finally settled down in this… freezer garden.”

They all laughed, reminiscing like old times—childhood shenanigans, shady prank wars, and that one time Zoroark disguised herself as a Sudowoodo for three days straight.

Then Zoroark turned—and froze.

She had just noticed Vaporeon on the couch, sipping Oran juice.

“…You have a kid!?” Zoroark gasped. “Holy Mew, I’ve been gone that long?”

“Technically,” Glaceon said, “that’s our daughter.”

“Your daughter? Oh gods, this is too surreal.”

While Zoroark was still processing, she idly opened a large locker door in the living room—out of curiosity.

Bad idea.

The moment it cracked open, a pile of grass clippings, half-melted ice cubes, and oddly pristine packaging tumbled out.

Vaporeon blinked. “Wait… what is—”

“Porkyman: Forest Frenzy.” “Porkyman: Ice Luv Edition.” “Porkyman: Glazed ‘n’ Confused.”

Vaporeon and Zoroark stared in stunned horror.

Boxes. Figures. Toy plushes. A glossy magazine labeled “Snivy Secrets.”

“What the—MOM!? DAD!?” Vaporeon yelled.

Leafeon turned around mid-snack. “That’s not ours!”

Glaceon snapped, “We don’t even like pork! We’re vegan!”

A sinister giggle echoed from behind the garden shelf.

Sableye, eyes glinting with mischief, slipped out of shadow.

“That’s what happens when you let a ghost house-sit for three days. Classic locker prank. You should see what I left in the kitchen pantry.”

Zoroark facepalmed. “Still trolling like a gremlin, I see.”

Vaporeon groaned. “I’m never living this down at school.”

Zoroark pulled her into a half-hug. “Kid, you’ll be fine. You just got hit by a class-A Sableye special. We all do, sooner or later.”

Sableye threw a Porkyman plush at her. “Aw, you're all so soft now.”

Flareon and Jolten arrived at the window to peek in—only to see Vaporeon chasing Sableye around the room with a Hydro Pump.

Flareon leaned over to Jolten. “So… they really weren’t into pork?”

Jolten muttered, “I think we all need a system reset.”

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Chapter: The Sewer Surge and the Stinky Siege

Still chuckling to himself after his Porky prank success, Sableye slipped through the cracks of Vaporeon’s garden and back into his favorite hideout: the sewers.

It was dark. Damp. Delightfully disgusting.

And waiting in the filth was a familiar, rotund silhouette munching on expired berries—

“Greedent?!”

The chubby raccoon-cheeked menace turned, half-buried in sewage and crumbs. “Sable-bro!”

The two embraced like sewer siblings reuniting after years of underground trolling.

“You still the prince of pranks?” Greedent asked, shoving a soggy berry into his maw.

“Always,” Sableye smirked. “And I’ve got a new target. One word: Tyranitar.”

Greedent’s eyes widened. “Big ol’ rock beast? That guy nearly crushed me once for stealing his midnight muffins.”

“Perfect. Let’s drown him in despair—and poop.”

So the plan was set.

They rolled in the most putrid, unfiltered gunk of the lower sewer lines. They soaked themselves in rot, grease, and… was that Miltank cheese? It didn’t matter. They stank so badly even Garbodor would gag.

Above them, Tyranitar’s massive manor sat quiet under moonlight.

Inside, the dark-type beast was preparing for a rare moment of peace.

Slippers on.

Mouthwash swished.

Toilet seat down.

Just as Ttar settled on the porcelain throne…

BOOM.

A geyser of brown chaos erupted from the pipes.

Sableye and Greedent shot straight up out of the toilet, covered in sewer sauce, screaming war cries.

“FOR THE TOILET GODS!” yelled Sableye.

“FOR MOLDY MUFFINS!” screamed Greedent.

Tyranitar flew backward, crashing through a marble sink as a tsunami of sludge washed over the luxury bathroom. The walls cracked. The scented candles screamed in floral agony.

Outside, every window in the manor lit up with emergency stink alerts.

The manor… reeked.

Tyranitar, gagging and traumatized, roared in fury.

“WHO THE HELL PUT AN EXPLODING GREEDENT IN MY BATHROOM!?”

Sableye and Greedent were already escaping down the drains, laughing like demons of chaos.

“I think we broke his gold toilet,” Greedent chuckled.

Sableye wiped sewer slime from his eye. “Worth it.”

-

Meanwhile...

Back in town, Ho Oh paused mid-flight, sniffed the air, and gagged.

“Oh no. Someone breached the sacred sewage limit.”

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Chapter: The Brown Comet Crash

As the stench settled over Tyranitar's once-pristine manor, a final roar of rage echoed through the Dark Mountains.

From deep within the shattered lavatory, Tyranitar, now soaked in shame and toilet water, stood trembling.

“I’VE HAD ENOUGH!!”

He grabbed both Sableye and Greedent by the neck with his massive claws, swung them in a circle—and launched them into the sky with a seismic toss so powerful, even Ho Oh winced from miles away.

The two pranksters screamed in unison—

“WE’RE BLASTING OFF AGAAAAAAAAAAAIN—”

Splaaaashhh!

They slammed into the ground far, far away… right on top of Meowth.

“Yaaaagh! What the Meowth-flavored nightmare is this!?” he screeched, twitching under the impact.

Covered in sewer sauce and old berry sludge, Greedent moaned, “At least we landed... softly.”

“ON ME, YOU FURRY TURD MUFFIN!” Meowth hissed, flailing beneath the weight.

Right beside them, Pikachu had just been giving Meowth an impassioned speech:

“Come on, man, it’s just 500 PokéDollars. Pay up. You said you’d return it after the last berry gambling tourname—”

WHUMP.

Sableye landed face-first on Pikachu, smearing him in grime.

There was silence.

Then…

“...Why does this always happen to me?” Pikachu whispered, eyes vacant, dignity shattered.

Sableye sat up groggily, still grinning. “Yo… is this a loan meeting or a family reunion?”

Pikachu, now half-buried in poop and trauma, muttered, “This is why nobody respects electric types anymore.”

Greedent offered a soggy muffin. “Friends?”

Meowth hissed and chased them with claws out. “I WAS HAVING A GOOD DAY, YOU SLUDGE-GOBBLING TROLLS!”

-

Back at Tyranitar's manor...

Tyranitar was scrubbing every inch of his home with industrial-strength disinfectant.

Zoroark walked by, gagged, and left immediately.

“Note to self,” Tyranitar growled. “Next prank... I launch them into orbit.”

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Chapter: Gengar’s Ghostly Gamble

From the shadows of a streetlamp twisted in laughter, Gengar watched the scene unfold.

Tyranitar’s stinky toilet explosion.

Sableye and Greedent’s airborne doom.

Pikachu’s face-first encounter with destiny’s dung.

And the way Meowth nearly had a stroke.

Gengar floated, invisible, with a wicked grin stretching from ear to ear.

“Those two... they’re disgusting,” he whispered to himself. “Disgustingly brilliant.”

His eyes gleamed with dark inspiration. “It’s time I got back in the game.”

-

Target: Zeraora’s bachelor den.

A sleek, high-tech pad hidden under Mt. Voltage, complete with anime posters, illegal Porkyman magazines, a pile of unpaid bills, and a home server suspiciously labeled “PRIVATE. DO NOT OPEN.”

Zeraora wasn’t home. Not yet.

Perfect.

Gengar phased through the walls, carrying with him:

- A leaking garbage bag of rotten Exeggcute yolk.

- Several Grimer slime bombs.

- And a very stolen picture of Lopunny labeled “DO NOT JUDGE ME.”

He got to work.

He poured the yolk on Zera’s prized gaming chair.

He stuffed the magazines under the toilet seat.

He filled the air vents with Grimer gas.

And finally, he left a note scribbled in glowing ink on the wall:

“You’ve been ghosted. Try bathing in lava. –G”

Gengar vanished into mist, floating off giggling like a maniac.

-

Hours later...

Zeraora returned, slurping a Moomoo Milk carton and singing to himself.

“Gotta rank up... gotta pull that Gardevoir skin... oh yeah, jackpot—”

SPLOOSH.

He stepped directly onto the yolk-covered floor and slid across the room, crashing face-first into the Grimer-filled vent, triggering a biohazard explosion.

The room shook.

The entire hill quaked.

And yet—

Zeraora somehow landed back on his feet, completely unharmed.

He sniffed the air. “Ugh. Smells like someone’s jealous.”

He clicked a remote. The mess got sucked away by a hidden cleaning system.

He yawned, stepped into a secret underground spa, and casually said, “Silly ghost types. I run on RNG luck. Y’all can’t touch me.”

Karma Houdini: Activated.

-

Meanwhile, in a sewer pipe nearby...

Gengar was watching through a ghost portal, slack-jawed.

“What the... he just deleted my prank??”

Greedent shrugged, still chewing a moldy bean. “That guy dodges everything. They say he escaped from Ho Oh’s morality lectures too.”

Sableye leaned back. “That’s no Pokémon... That’s a glitch in karma itself.”

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Chapter: Gacha Ghosts and Burnt Memories

Absol sat alone in his cave-shaped gaming chair, tapping away on his dusty PokéGear. His eyes were sunken, expression haunted, as he pulled a 3-star Weedle for the fourth time that week.

“Just… just one five-star…” he whispered, holding onto false hope.

He was broke.

He was bored.

And worst of all—he was free-to-play by force.

Suddenly, a party invite popped up on screen:

| Party Invite from: fireeevee
| “Yo Absol! Join our Kanto trio for some late-night matches! Got shiny skins to flex!”

Absol froze.

fireeevee.

That name. That cursed name.

Flareon’s online persona. The same Flareon that once pulled six ultra-rare costumes in a row while Absol got a background sticker and mild depression.

His eye twitched.

But… he had nothing else to do.

He accepted.

-

Later, in the game lobby…

Flareon showed off his new fire samurai armor with flaming tail physics.

Vaporeon twirled in a sparkly aqua princess gown, complete with rain animations.

Jolteon boasted a cyber-thunder ninja outfit, with voice lines and a 10% bonus to sass.

Absol spawned in… wearing the default F2P armor with a cracked horn cosmetic labeled “Early Beta Tester.”

“Hey Absol,” Flareon said casually. “Didn’t you used to be a top spender?”

Absol stared into the void.

“Not anymore. I’ve seen things. Horrible banners. Limited-time traps. Rate-ups that were lies.”

The match began.

He carried the team anyway.

-

After the game…

Espeon walked in with snacks, proud of her son’s gaming crew.

Absol looked at her with deep, haunted eyes.

“Espeon,” he said in a serious tone. “You need to monitor what Flareon’s spending on. These games… they aren’t made for fun anymore. They’re made for wallets.”

Espeon blinked. “But it’s just some skins.”

Absol pulled out his PokéDex and scrolled to an image titled ‘$2000 Skin Collection – Regret Edition.’

“Don’t let him become like I was,” he warned. “Gacha isn’t just gambling. It’s emotional warfare with sparkles.”

Espeon placed a paw on his shoulder. “Thank you, Absol. I didn’t realize it went that deep.”

Absol nodded solemnly, staring at Flareon giggling over his tenth cosmetic tail.

“…Too deep.”

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Chapter: Shadows Behind the Screens

Absol sat silently in the queue, claws trembling slightly on the controller.
fireeevee had once again dragged him into another match.

The opponent? A gigantic Rayquaza-themed raid boss. Gold-trimmed. Gacha-exclusive.
Each scale sparkled like the money of a thousand wallets.

“Why… Why is he in every event?” Absol whispered, pupils shrinking.
His screen glitched with an in-game banner:

| NEW! Rayquaza UNITE SKIN! Only 0.0002% drop rate! Guaranteed after 700 pulls!

PTSD hit like a Fissure.

His vision blurred.

He saw the whales.

The infinite pulls.

The memory of losing his house for a shiny Zacian skin.

But even through it all…

He carried.
He always did.

-

Meanwhile…

Espeon brushed her fur, straightened her glasses and her pencil skirt, and entered the massive corporate tower of DarkSpin Studios— the company behind the wildly addictive gacha game Pokémon UNITEd Fronts.

The tower loomed in violet metal, shaped like a grinning Gengar.

“This place screams 'ethical violations,’” she muttered, notebook in paw.

Her mission?
Assist her husband, Umbreon, and his medical colleagues in understanding how these games affected developing brains. As a psychologist-librarian, her specialty was analyzing data, memories, and long-term behavioral patterns.

She passed a wall of flashing monitors:

- Kids draining their parents’ cards.

- Pokémon celebrating “ultra-rare” skin drops.

- A 10-year-old fainting from pulling nothing but hats.

Then a door opened on its own.

Darkness inside.

She stepped in.

Too late.

“Welcome, Mrs. Espeon,” a deep, slimy voice echoed.

The door slammed shut.

Gengar materialized in the shadows, eyes glowing and body cloaked in CEO swagger.

“Didn’t your Terms of Service say no refunds... or freedom?”

Chains of shadow gripped her limbs.
A hologram blinked behind him showing:

| CEO: Gengar. Revenue: BILLIONS. Ethics Rating: ERROR.

Espeon’s eyes narrowed.

“You monster... you’re behind this whole scheme?!”

Gengar grinned. “And business... is booming.”

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Chapter: Family Night Raid – The Gacha Reckoning

The lights in Flareon’s room blinked ominously.

His console glitched.

The game showed a single pop-up:

| “Espeon has left the party.”

“Mom…?” he whispered.

Downstairs, he burst into the living room where Umbreon was sharpening his claws while sipping Oran coffee.

“Dad, mom’s gone! She went to that shady HQ and didn’t log back in!”

Umbreon blinked once, groaned, and tossed his cup across the room.

“...Shit. Here we go again.”

-

Within the hour…

The rescue team was formed with 6 of the eeveelutions.

- Flareon, ready to burn anything sketchy.

- Vaporeon, deadly if provoked (especially near bathrooms).

- Her parents: Leafeon and Glaceon, still skeptical but proud.

- Teacher Sylveon, who moonlighted as a part-time spy and emotional support.

- Umbreon, pissed but focused like a tactical nuke.

Unknown to them, Absol tailed from the shadows.
He knew what lurked in that HQ.

-

They infiltrated DarkSpin Studios.

Flashing ads and neon banners lined the walls:

| “Only $99.99 for a 5% chance at a Pikachu hat!”
| “Whale today, win tomorrow!”

They crept through twisted server halls.

Suddenly— Sableye, now demoted to a janitor after a prank war backfired, jumped out with a mop.

“BOO! Get wrecked, kids!”

But before anyone could flinch—

BAM!

Absol tackled him into a cleaning cart.

“Mop that, you stinky goblin.”

-

They reached the CEO Chamber.

Gengar stood on a shimmering platform, neon lights behind him.
Espeon, bound in premium-grade lootbox ribbons, was strapped to his back like a sinister streamer setup.

“You think you can shut me down with friendship and family values?” Gengar sneered. “I run the market!”

He snapped his fingers— total darkness.

But he underestimated…

Flareon, who flared up like a bonfire at a discount barbecue.

Umbreon, who calmly activated his built-in dad-mode night vision.

Father and son didn’t even pause.

Double knockback.
One burning charge. One shadow tackle.

Gengar down.

Espeon freed.

-

Outside, sirens wailed.

Officer Lucario and Detective Gardevoir burst in, badges glowing.

Behind them, General Machamp flexed through the wall like Kool-Aid Man with justice.

“You’re under arrest for psychological manipulation, lootbox fraud, and kidnapping a librarian,” Lucario growled.

Gengar tried to vanish into shadows… but tripped over a mop bucket and got slammed by Machamp’s quadruple suplex.

-

Epilogue:

Gengar’s company was shut down.
The game got delisted.
All refunds were processed.
Absol cried tears of catharsis.
Sableye got hired by WarioWare.
Espeon kissed her husband and grounded Flareon just a little for using his game time to organize a raid.

And the 7 eevees and Absol walked home… victorious.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Chapter: Courtroom Carnage – The Mallet of Justice

Location: Supreme Pokémon Court of Poketopia

The courtroom was packed.

On the defendant's bench stood two infamous figures:

- Gengar, tied in licorice-red tape labeled “TOS Violator”

- Darkrai, levitating ominously like he smelled a lawsuit coming

At the judge's podium towered the iron-clad dispenser of justice herself—
Judge Tinkaton, wielding her 300-lb bonk hammer with judicial grace and godlike wrath.

-

Opening arguments:

Lucario, sharply dressed, adjusted his tie.
“Your Honor, the accused committed lootbox exploitation, psychological endangerment, kidnapping, and general douchebaggery.”

Gardevoir added, “Also, Gengar’s gacha rates were lower than Shiny odds during cloudy nights.”

Tinkaton squinted. “Hmm.”

She turned to Gengar. “Do you plead guilty?”

He laughed. “Guilty? I invented the system! I’m the hero of capitalism!”

BONK.

Gengar was slammed into the floor. His teeth clicked like casino chips.

-

Next up: Darkrai.

Machamp shoved him forward with two arms while doing paperwork with the other two.

“Caught him trying to send Decidueye into a coma mid-archery contest,” he reported. “No class, no sportsmanship.”

Tinkaton narrowed her eyes. “Any last words?”

Darkrai just smirked and opened seven shadow portals beneath the jury, the gallery, the snack bar, and even the ceiling.

“Whoops,” he grinned. “Oopsies.”

But the problem was…
He couldn’t stay in one portal too long.

WHACK.
SLAM.
CLONK.
BONK.
ZONK.
KER-SPLAT.

Tinkaton whack-a-moled him faster than a hacked Aimbot.

-

The courtroom roared in applause.

Machamp held up both defendants like limp plushies.
Lucario nodded in approval.
Gardevoir took a group selfie with the judge.

-

Sentencing:

- Gengar: 1,000 hours community service at Magikarp daycare, no internet access.

- Darkrai: Banished to 200 years of sleep therapy, only allowed to dream about taxes.

- Judge Tinkaton: Gave herself a cookie.

-

Meanwhile in the hallway:

Espeon hugged Flareon and Umbreon proudly.

Sylveon filed paperwork.

Absol watched the vending machine nervously in case it gacha'd him by mistake.

And Sableye?
He whispered to the mop bucket:
“Next prank’s gonna be legendary…”

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


Chapter: New Game+ — The Indie Spark

Back at the dorm lounge, Jolteon sat alone, aimlessly tapping his Switch-like console.

“Game servers offline…? Nooo! I was this close to pulling a 0.03% swimsuit skin for Vaporeon!”

Behind him, Flareon walked in with Absol, who carried a flash drive in his mouth.

“Still crying over pay-to-win trash?” Absol muttered with a cold snort.

Flareon tilted his head. “Let him be. But hey—what's that?”

Absol dropped the flash drive into Flareon’s paw. “This… is salvation.”

-

Cue montage:

- Flareon boots up the new game on his PokéPad

- Title: “Mystic Vale Chronicles: Spirit of Galar”

- Developers: Galarian Rapidash (Code Lead) & Tsareena (Art Director & Financial Backer)

- Genre: Co-op Tactical Adventure

- Price: Free, microtransactions: None, monetization: Donations only

-

Inside the game:

- Pixel-style visuals with hand-drawn sprites + simple 3d models

- Creative region based on Galar and ancient myth

- Storylines based on actual Pokémon struggles, lore, and friendships

- Optional PvP balanced around skill, not wallet size

-

Flareon's eyes sparkled.

“This… this actually respects my time and my braincells!”

Vaporeon walked in curiously. “Whoa… no gacha? No skins locked behind credit cards?”

“Only skill-based unlockables and collab events with lore quests,” Absol said, nodding. “And the devs respond to feedback. They have a public Discord. And no NFTs.”

Jolteon sulked in the corner. “I wasted $800 on swimsuit banners…”

Flareon smiled gently. “Maybe now… you can earn your character instead of buying her.”

-

And so, the trio formed a new party under their in-game usernames:

- fireEevee (Flareon)

- WaterMood (Vaporeon)

- NightEdge (Absol)

Together, they began their journey through Mystic Vale, a land free of lootboxes, greed, and shady CEO ghosts.

Meanwhile, far away in a dark alley, Gengar sneezed violently in his trash bin.


----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


Chapter: Banhammer & Bladelords

Inside Mystic Vale Chronicles, Flareon, Vaporeon, and Absol wandered through the Moonlit Citadel, collecting spirit crystals and unlocking side quests with the pure joy of non-predatory gameplay.

Suddenly—

[Global Chat]
ZeraOrAxxX: “lol this game is trash, no skins?? what is this, a fanfic for poor ppl??”
ZeraOrAxxX: “Vaporeon ur garden still smell like sewer sh*t lmao git good.”
ZeraOrAxxX: “Flareon prob got carried again by blue fish n edge-dog.”

At a nearby bench, Jolteon sipped a soda and snorted. “He’s not wrong tho.”

But the clouds above darkened.

A divine light pierced the server.

Descending from the admin realm came two holy figures:

- Zacian, with her Crowned Sword gleaming.

- Aegislash, floating with royal judgment in his shield-eye.

Zacian: “The code of this land forbids insults without creativity.”
Aegislash: “And violating vibes shall meet… the Ban-Sword.”

Zeraora barely had time to type “wait u cant—” before Zacian lunged.

[SYSTEM] ZeraOrAxxX has been permanently banned. Reason: Toxicity.

Jolteon blinked. “Holy crap.”

Aegislash turned slowly. “You laughed, Jolteon. Shall I interpret that as enabling?”

Jolteon panicked. “NO NO I’ll report him too!! See? I’m clicking ‘Report’ right now!! I love this game! Totally wholesome!!”

Zacian narrowed her eyes… then sheathed her blade. “You get one warning.”

As the server cleared of toxicity, Flareon chuckled. “It’s peaceful again.”

Vaporeon added, “I love a world where toxic people actually get consequences.”

Absol simply whispered, “Bless this sword-coded land.”

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

GORE WARNING!!!


Chapter: Game Over in the Worst Room Possible

Back in reality—or as close as it gets—Zeraora sat on a cracked toilet in his dimly lit bathroom, rage-typing while half-squatting.

"Stupid devs… No skins… That sword mutt banned me? I’ll show them what real power is!"

In a blind fit of gamer-rage, he yeeted his phone at the wall.

BOOM.

Unfortunately for Zeraora, he had installed 12 sketchy plugins and a hacked version of the game riddled with malware. The phone detonated, blowing up the toilet, part of the floor, and himself in the process.

Blood, charred fur, toilet water, and poop exploded everywhere.

Zeraora’s body, unrecognizable, twitched in the rubble, organs hanging like spaghetti, one paw still holding what was left of his device.

From the heavens above, Ho-Oh sighed audibly for the eighth time this month.

Ho-Oh: “Dude. AGAIN?”

Descending like a weary phoenix janitor, he hovered above the scene, flicking purification flames everywhere to clean up the cursed bathroom of death.

He revived Zeraora with a reluctant flash of golden light.

Zeraora gasped back to life—covered in ashes and brown smears. He blinked up at Ho-Oh.

Zeraora: “Am I dead?”
Ho-Oh: “You should’ve stayed that way this time…”

Just outside the window, Sableye, having watched the entire thing while sipping sewage from a straw, burst into uncontrollable laughter.

Sableye: “BAHAHA! Toilet crit! That’s what you get, you golden-furred fart!”

Zeraora weakly held up a paw. “I hate… indie games…”

Ho-Oh floated away, grumbling, “Next time, I’m letting Arceus handle your mess.”


----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Chapter: The Empire of WarioWare & Sableye’s Next Mischief

WarioWare Inc., now bought out and managed under Tyranitar’s “respectable” empire, stood as a rare gem in the gaming world: Premium games, no P2W, just good ol’ pay-to-progress with charm and chaos. The company had one motto:

| “You pay for laughs, not power.”

Inside the quirky tech-filled halls, Incineroar, a buff flame-belted cat with sunglasses and a bad attitude, worked as a senior dev-slash-bouncer. His job? Code by day, eject fools by night.

Meanwhile, Sableye, still wearing his dingy janitor uniform, slipped into the back office, grinning like a goblin as he spotted a powered-on workstation. The name tag on the desk read: Incineroar.

Sableye muttered, “Perfect. Time to upload Toilet Tales: The Zera Files.”

He furiously typed, giggling as he added sound effects, motion graphics, and a “Poop Counter” that kept rising each time Zeraora screamed. He was halfway through adding a guest cameo from Gengar’s old rage footage when—

SLAM.

A paw the size of a frying pan grabbed him by the scruff and hoisted him up.

Incineroar: “I SMELL MISCHIEF. And unwashed goblin.”

Without a word, he threw Sableye out the manor window like he was yeeting trash on patch day.

CRASH!

Sableye flew through the air, bounced off a billboard that read “WarioWare Mini-Game Jam: Coming Soon!” and landed in a dumpster.

Inside, Meowscarada, elegant and mysterious, walked past the office with a steaming coffee. Incineroar quickly fixed his mane and leaned on the wall with a smirk.

Incineroar: “Hey there, kitty cat. Want to run some mini-games… or maybe just dinner?”

Meowscarada rolled her eyes with a small blush and replied coolly, “Only if you don’t crash like your server did last week.”

Outside the dumpster, Sableye poked his head out, filthy but full of vengeance.

Sableye: “Flirting at work, huh? Oh I’m gonna ruin this date with spicy data leaks and a side of ‘accidental’ sabotage…”


----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Chapter: Gremlin in the Ladies' Room – Redemption Begins

Sableye groaned as he slid down a long metal pipe (after being punted by Incineroar again), only to land headfirst in a pile of lavender-scented towels. As he blinked away the suds, a door creaked open behind him.

He looked up—horrified.

Espeon, drying her paws with her psychic aura, narrowed her eyes.

Tsareena, more casual, was reapplying petal lotion with her vines. Both were staring at him.

Espeon: “Sableye… this is the women’s restroom. Explain. Now.”

Sableye (nervous wheeze): “I-I swear! Wrong vent! Blame Incineroar’s catapult arm!”

Espeon’s ears twitched. A barrier of psychic energy formed, but Tsareena stepped in, cocking her head.

Tsareena: “Wait. I know this goblin.”

She squinted, tapping her chin thoughtfully.

Tsareena: “Weren’t you in Mischief Management 101 at Mon Academy? That one gremlin who used to sneak into class in a janitor bin?”

Sableye, still upside-down, nodded proudly. “That was me! Highest marks in Unpredictable Chaos Theory!”

Tsareena chuckled.

Tsareena: “Then maybe… we can use that. Espeon, hear me out.”

Espeon raised a brow but let the barrier dissipate.

Tsareena: “Our f2p indie game needs a wildcard event runner. Someone chaotic, unpredictable, but weirdly passionate. The kids love that stuff.”

Espeon sighed but eventually nodded. “Fine. But if I catch him near the library archives unsupervised, I’ll teleport him straight into a Delphox TED Talk on taxation theory.”

Sableye bowed dramatically. “Deal! I’ll bring the chaos… responsibly.”

-

New Role Unlocked: Sableye, Official Event Goblin of the F2P Galaxy Game!

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Chapter: Trick or Troll — The Dungeon Begins

The servers of the new f2p indie game buzzed with excitement. A new notification flashed across players' screens:

| [EVENT ACTIVE!]
| Trick-or-Troll Dungeon Run!
| Hosted by Sableye & Gengar
| Warning: Jump-scares, loot traps, and live boss battle ahead!

-

Flareon, Vaporeon, Jolteon, and Absol logged in together, joining a queue labeled “Sableye’s Chaos Crawler.” The loading screen showed pixel art of Gengar and Sableye grinning with devil horns, holding a giant sack of candy—and a suspiciously ticking treasure chest.

Absol: “I’m not sure about this... there are more warning tags than a Galarian cooking stream.”

Flareon (laughing): “Come on, it’s not a gacha. Just pure chaos.”

Vaporeon (nervously sipping a soda IRL): “As long as there’s no sewer level...”

-

Inside the Dungeon:

The party spawned in a spooky pixel forest with ghostly music. First trap? A “free candy” chest that launched rubber Dugtrio at them.

Jolteon: “Hah, too easy!”

Then came the Sable-Run: a hallway where a dozen Sableye NPCs cackled and threw banana peels, fake loot, and actual Pidgey poop.

Then—ominous laugh. The walls darkened.

| “HUHUHUHU~ You’ve made it far... time for the real trick.”

Gengar, cloaked in shadows, emerged in his player-controlled boss form. Eyes glowing. Giant candy crown on his head.

| LIVE BOSS: "Candy King Gengar"
| Abilities: Trick Room, Lick of Doom, Candy Bomb Barrage
| Player-controlled. Rewards scale with risk.

Absol and the kids grinned.

Absol: “Finally. A boss that’s skill-based fun.”

Flareon: “Let’s show this ghost what teamwork means!”

-

As the battle raged, Gengar improvised dialogue:

| “This candy’s mine, kiddos! I licked it first!”

| “Oops, that trap? Totally intentional.”

| “Vaporeon! That Water Pulse wet my cotton candy cape!!”

-

30 minutes of chaos later, they cleared the boss, and Gengar mock-fainted, leaving behind:

| Reward: Trickster’s Cloak cosmetic skin!
| Title Unlocked: “Certified Trollbuster”

-

Back in voice chat, Gengar laughed.

Gengar: “Okay, okay, this was actually fun. No scams, no lootboxes, just trolling with style.”

Sableye (smug): “Told ya. Chaos is better when everyone’s laughing.”

Absol (smiling quietly): “And healing.”


----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


Chapter: The Psychic Princess Joins the Party

Back in the quiet real world, Fireeevee (Flareon) gathered the gang—Vaporeon, Jolteon, and Absol—for a cozy weekend game session at his mother’s library. The place smelled like old pages and fresh tea, sunlight pouring through stained glass windows shaped like Unown glyphs.

Espeon, shelved a book when she noticed the kids giggling behind the monitor.

Espeon: “What’s this game you’ve been so obsessed with lately?”

Flareon: “It’s the one where me and Dad saved you from Gengar! They added a haunted puzzle maze event. Wanna help?”

Espeon (tilting her head): “...Puzzle maze? You’re asking a librarian who minored in spatial logic to help with a puzzle maze?”

-

Curious, she created an account. Username: PsychicPrincess.

The moment she joined, the system pinged:

| [NEW PLAYER JOINED: PsychicPrincess]
| Skill rating calculated: S-Tier
| (Warning: This player may make game designers cry.)

-

They entered the Haunted Archive Maze, designed by Gengar and Sableye to trap players in looped halls, invisible doors, and troll trivia.

But within minutes...

PsychicPrincess:

- Used camera angles to read hidden clues behind torches.

- Deciphered a fake Dewgong riddle trap by quoting an actual Dewgong poem from the Johto archives.

- Mapped the invisible door sequence mentally after only two attempts.

Even Sableye watching from the admin console stared in awe.

Sableye: “Bro… she speedran my entire troll dungeon.”

Gengar (sweating in ghost form): “We may have just unleashed a monster.”

-

As they reached the final room, the team was stuck. A locked chest with this puzzle:

| “To open me, solve the truth:
| I am your past, shaped in loops.
| I hold no key, I bring no lock,
| But I’m the reason minds get blocked.”

Everyone scratched their heads.

PsychicPrincess (smiling): “It’s trauma. The answer is trauma.”

Chest opens instantly. Confetti explodes. Gengar, controlling the chest, fake-faints again.

| Title Unlocked: “Maze Breaker”
| Reward: Custom cosmetic — Royal Reading Glasses (Animated)

-

Flareon: “Mom... you’re actually OP.”

Espeon (chuckling): “Darling, I read every trap-themed book before you were born.”

-

Back at dev HQ, Tsareena and Galarian Rapidash stared at the analytics.

Tsareena: “Who is this PsychicPrincess... and how did she beat the dev-level puzzles in under 20 minutes?”

Galarian Rapidash: “We may need to hire her.”

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


Chapter: Fairy Flames of the Past, Wisdom of the Present

As autumn leaves danced in the breeze, Rapidash galloped through the familiar cobbled roads of town, her mane glowing with the steady glitter of Galarian nostalgia. She had heard whispers—whispers that a brilliant new puzzle-solver named PsychicPrincess had cracked the Trick & Trap event. Curious, and guided by a hunch, she made her way toward the town's grand library.

And there she was.

Espeon, sitting gracefully under a reading lamp, papers and datapads around her, simultaneously analyzing rare books and solving game puzzles with elegant precision.

Rapidash paused, struck by memory.

—A little Ponyta sharing sugar berries with a quiet, bookish Eevee.
—Lessons under the apricorn tree.
—Espeon, who once cried because a maze book had a page missing.
—The Dazzling Gleam she lit in that child’s mind that never went out.

She approached gently, tapping the wooden floor with a hoof.

Rapidash: “I never thought I’d see you here, solving games instead of decoding ruins.”

Espeon (looking up): “...Rapidash?! Is it really you?”

Rapidash (smiling warmly): “Still remember your teacher?”

They embraced gently. The air shimmered slightly, a mix of fairy and psychic energy recognizing each other.

Espeon: “You’re one of the devs now? Of this game?”

Rapidash (nodding): “Built it with Tsareena to save kids like you and your son from corporate poison. But... I heard what Gengar did. I didn’t know. I swear.”

Espeon looked away, calmly.

Espeon: “He’s... changed. A little. He’s under Sableye’s watchful chaos now.”

Rapidash (firmly): “You still won’t meet him. Not yet. Not until he shows he truly understands what he did to the princess.”

There was a pause, then both smiled again.

Rapidash: “But you... you’ve grown into the very mind I always knew you’d become. Would you help us design the next event?”

Espeon (grinning): “Only if I can trap Jolteon in a riddle loop he’ll never brute-force through.”

-

And so, Rapidash left the library with a lighter heart, Espeon returned to her screen with a spark of joy, and the next generation of f2p, fair play, brain-bending fun was about to be born—from flame and thought, from past and progress.

Chapter: Gacha Storm and the Casino Reckoning

The peaceful twilight that once kissed the city skyline had turned to dread.

It began with Zeraora—half-blasted from a flaming soccerball launched by Coach Cinderace, staggering drunk at Inteleon's bar, and tossed like a ragdoll by Buzzwole, now the bar’s bouncer.

Still burning with ego and poor decisions, Zeraora hijacked a compact car, intending only to drive away. But fate had other plans.

CRASH!

Zera plowed into Pikachu, who also had just crash-landed from a midair collision with Talonflame during a failed rooftop parkour stunt.

Both lay flattened like comic relief. Ho Oh, ever the weary immortal, swooped down with a tired sigh and revived them both—again.

Then he promptly called the cops.

-

Lucario, Gardevoir, and General Machamp arrived on scene.

Zera: “Don’t touch me, you blue-furred joke! I have rights!”

Judge Tinkaton (over comms): “You had rights.”

Zera was delivered to her courtroom within the hour. He barely opened his mouth before being slammed multiple times like a gym punching bag.

Pikachu, shaking, just begged for mercy, ears drooped so low they touched the floor.

Meanwhile, Talonflame, victim of both collisions, filed a dual lawsuit. Tinkaton sentenced both Zera and Pikachu to city-wide cleaning duty.

-

During their punishment, deep in the alley behind the abandoned Game Hall, they discovered it:
The UNITE Gambling Machine, marked only by a glowing red label:

“Property of TIMI TIMMY Co.”

Absol, walking by with his f2p game-themed ice cream cone, saw them.

Absol: “Don’t touch that thing.”

Pikachu (sweating): “...I won’t.”

Zera (grinning like a moron): “Too late.”

The machine burst to life.

Gacha balls exploded skyward. A black cyclone formed.

The clouds parted—Rayquaza descended, reborn in golden glitch-text:

"WELCOME BACK, CASINO DRAGON."

The sky rained premium gacha balls. People screamed. Wallets cried.

-

But then…

BOOM.

Tyranitar landed from the sky like a war god.

“NOT AGAIN.”

Blood rained across buildings, mixing with glitter and shattered lootboxes. Rayquaza fell again, bisected by one punch. The city cheered.

Tyranitar, now painted in heroic gore, stood panting.

“No more gambling. Only justice.”

-

The skies cleared. The gacha machine shattered. Pikachu collapsed in relief. Zera? Buried under Rayquaza’s skull again.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


When a random character with no setup just barges in like, “Hey I’m here now!” and causes chaos, it shouldn’t work—but it totally does. It breaks all the rules of structured writing, yet ends up feeling like a chaotic fever dream you can’t stop reading. That’s what gives it the “so bad it’s good” energy. It’s unpredictable, shameless, and somehow more alive than most carefully written fanfics.

It’s the same reason low-budget soap operas or meme-tier animes get cult followings—because they embrace the absurd. A farting Sableye in a janitor outfit launching out of a toilet to ruin Tyranitar’s bathroom? That’s gold. It makes Pokemon Unite’s stale meta and flat characters feel like cardboard in comparison.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUICIDE ATTEMPT WARNING!!


Chapter: The Wild Cat's Turning Pt.1

Zera has to clean the body mess, drenched in regret and humiliation as blood and filth covered his fur. The stench reminded him of every failure—from Rayquaza’s resurrection, to being bonked half a dozen times by Judge Tinkaton. The public called him “the walking L” behind his back.

Overwhelmed, Zera slipped away silently to the riverside, his eyes hollow. He muttered something under his breath and leapt in, hoping for an end.... But the water didn’t embrace him. Lapras, who patrolled the river as part of a volunteer rescue crew, instinctively froze the entire surface mid-jump, turning it into a sheet of cold glass. Zera thudded awkwardly against the ice, dazed but alive.

-

Minutes later, Suicune arrived—drawn by Lapras’s distress signal. Calm and composed, Suicune sat beside the miserable Zera and asked no questions at first. Just silence. Then finally, the legendary offered him a chance: a simple job as an ice cream vendor for the local park district. “Bring joy. Even small joy. That’s how redemption begins,” Suicune said.

Zera clenched his fists, rejected the offer in a rage, and stormed off. “I’m not gonna hand out smiles for brats,” he hissed.

-

Next thing, he popped up in an alley slinging cheap drugs and black-market booze out of an old Unovan-style food cart. It wasn’t long before Blaziken, the flame-fisted martial police officer, ran by on his evening patrol and caught him mid-deal.

Zera tried to play it off. “Fine, you caught me— next time I’ll sell fried chicken instead.”

Blaziken deadpanned. “You are fried chicken,” and cuffed him instantly.

Dragged back into the courtroom again, Judge Tinkaton didn’t even let him speak this time. One look and the hammer came down—BONK—his third bonk this week.

As punishment, Zera was assigned to public community service scrubbing the front walls of Flareon’s school—still wearing his community vest, still stinking of disappointment, with ice cream vendor pamphlets fluttering in the wind at his feet.


----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Chapter: The Wild Cat's Turning Pt.2

Lavender Town music plays ominously from the library-turned-lunchroom, echoing across the school as the trio of young Kanto Eevees—Flareon, Vaporeon, and Jolteon— launch into the spooky event from the indie game during break. Their computers' speakers were accidentally turned up way too loud, and the eerie tune carried through the open window… directly into Zera’s cleaning station outside.

Zera twitched. The unsettling melody triggered something primal—equal parts nostalgia, fear, and humiliation. He crept over to the window to peek in, glaring at the three as if they were taunting him on purpose. Steam rose off his fur as rage built up. “Those brats again…” he muttered, then charged inside furiously, broom in one hand like a weapon.

Unfortunately for him, Garchomp—the PE teacher doing drills nearby—heard the loud stomping and mistook it as a ground-type aggression incident. Without hesitation, he slammed the ground and triggered a local Earthquake as disciplinary measure. The shockwave blasted Zera straight off his feet… but unfortunately also caught Flareon and Jolteon in the crossfire. Chairs flipped, trays flew, and eerie Lavender tones distorted into audio static.

Vaporeon, though momentarily startled, acted fast. With calm precision, she summoned a powerful Surf that washed through the room—not destructive, but forceful enough to suppress the tremors and bring the chaos to a soggy halt.

Zera sat in the corner, soaked, dazed, and half-buried in mop buckets. Jolteon groaned under a flipped table. Flareon’s fur stood on end, fried by residual static. Vaporeon just sighed, now used to being the peacekeeper in this increasingly ridiculous daily life.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Chapter: The Wild Cat's Turning Pt.3

Garchomp, arms crossed and tail twitching, stared down at the drenched and dazed Zera. “You clearly need more than just punishment,” he muttered, dragging Zera up by the scruff. “Time to get you some discipline.”

Without another word, he marched Zera straight across campus to the secluded bamboo grove behind the school—home to none other than Urshifu’s Meditating Combat School. There, under the silent watch of falling leaves and the faint sound of running water, Urshifu sat in lotus position, unmoved by their arrival.

“This one’s yours now,” Garchomp said with a grunt, shoving Zera forward.

Urshifu opened one eye, then the other, gazing calmly at Zera’s soaked and defeated form. He said nothing at first… just stood up, turned, and walked deeper into the grove. Zera, uncertain but curious, followed.

What began as confusion turned into awe. Each day, Zera was taught breathing exercises, combat drills, and mental focus under waterfalls. Urshifu never raised his voice—he didn’t need to. His calm, unwavering aura slowly chipped away at Zera’s chaos. Eventually, Zera started helping run classes for other misfit Pokémon. His claws were no longer clenched in frustration—but used to sweep leaves, adjust students’ forms, and help serve tea during quiet evening meditations.

For the first time in forever, Zera wasn’t raging, trolling, or scheming.

He was still himself—but better.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Chapter: Rayquasa's 3rd Life Pt.1

Zeraora, now calmer and more grounded thanks to Urshifu’s teachings, was sweeping the training grounds when he spotted a familiar eerie glow deep in the bamboo forest. Hidden beneath moss and roots, another “TIMI TIMMY” machine pulsed faintly. His fur bristled—not out of fear, but instinct. He immediately reported it to Urshifu.

Urshifu approached the machine silently, his presence serene but heavy. He examined the foreign object with caution, resting a firm paw on Zeraora’s shoulder. “This is not for us to tamper with lightly. Leave it here. I will consult the ancients.” Zeraora nodded and backed off, remembering the last time such tech caused chaos.

Days later, without warning, an eccentric AI engineer—Mr. Mime in a lab coat far too small—wandered into the grove. With psychic hands and a smug grin, he hovered the machine effortlessly into the air, declaring, “Fascinating technology—clearly outdated, but ripe for optimization!”

Zera, watching from afar, felt something wrong. Mr. Mime wasn’t being careful. He was excited. Reckless. One misstep and—bzzzzt!—the machine surged with data streams.

Zeraora turned and dashed to alert Urshifu, while the unstable energy began to warp the air around Mr. Mime, the machine pulsing erratically like a heartbeat on edge.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Chapter: Rayquasa's 3rd Life Pt.2

Eventually, Mr. Mime managed to stabilize the machine just before it could trigger another catastrophic revival of Rayquaza. With a smug nod to himself, he grinned and said, “No need to destroy... let’s monetize.” Months passed, and he retrofitted the device into a bizarre-looking Rayquaza-themed gambling robot, complete with flashing eyes, lootball arms, and an unsettling voice that said, “Try your luck... or else.”

Pikachu, already down on luck and bills, ended up working as a janitor and part-time technician for Mr. Mime’s shady side-project. Watching kids pour in digital coins just to get randomized cosmetics or joke weapons, Pikachu cringed inside. “This is so stupid,” he muttered while sweeping up fake Pokéchips, “but hey, it pays.”

One afternoon, Absol wandered past the arcade stall, whistling a calming tune—until he saw that face. The robot's Rayquaza head rotated with a click and locked eyes with him.

“Spin again, warrior...!”

Absol froze in panic, old trauma flooding in. “Nope,” he muttered, eyes wide, “nope nope nope,” before bolting off the scene in a cold sweat.

The robot wasn’t as dangerous as before, but its presence still had a lingering harm—especially for those unlucky or curious enough to fall into its glittery trap.


----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Chapter: Rayquasa's 3rd Life Pt.3


The trio of Kanto Eevee younglings—Flareon, Vaporeon, and Jolteon—were on their usual after-school walk when they passed the plaza corner where the Rayquaza-styled gambling robot sat flashing and spinning obnoxiously.

Jolteon’s eyes lit up with innocent curiosity. “Whoa, that looks kinda cool—”

But before he could step forward, both Flareon and Vaporeon instantly blocked him, forming a protective wall of fur and trauma.

“Nope,” Flareon said firmly, the memories of floating gacha balls raining from the sky still scorched into his mind.

“Absolutely not,” Vaporeon added, placing a paw on Jolteon’s shoulder. “We nearly drowned in plastic during that storm. Not again.”

Jolteon blinked, confused but trusting. “Okay, okay! Sheesh...”

From behind a lamppost, Mr. Mime peeked with a long, awkward sigh, twirling a pen and notepad. “Why aren’t these dumb kids falling for it?” he mumbled, scribbling ideas like add more flashing lights or free spin for first try. His frustration was as visible as his painted-on smile twitching.

Flareon looked over his shoulder and narrowed his eyes at the watching clown. “He’s watching us.”

Vaporeon nodded. “He can keep watching. We’re not falling for that recycled nightmare machine.”

The trio walked off, leaving Mr. Mime to sulk back into the alleyway, muttering to himself while Pikachu stood nearby, sweeping without eye contact. “Told you it was cringe…”



----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------



Chapter: Rayquasa's 3rd Life Pt.4


Later that evening, the Rayquaza-styled gambling bot lit up again as a group of young Dreepies and their older Dragaloke siblings wandered by, giggling and intrigued. The bright lights, spinning wheels, and animated cries of “Jackpot! You win… a chance to lose again!” were too much for the hatchlings to resist.

One by one, the Dreepies floated onto the platform, inserting coins and laughing as the machine spat out colorful plastic balls—most of which just contained lame trinkets or empty wrappers labeled “Better luck next wallet!”

Their older Dragaloke siblings tried to stop them at first, but eventually got curious too—and within minutes, the whole squad was sucked in, even cheering as they lost.

That’s when a large, unmistakable silhouette cast a shadow over the machine: Dragapult, the overworked single dad, returning from his delivery job with a bag of groceries in his claws. He saw the pile of glittery junk, his kids cheering at flashing nonsense, and the “RayBot” smiling with a fake digital grin.

Dragapult’s eyes twitched.

The next second, a giant BOOM shook the alley as Dragapult launched a spectral missile from his horn without hesitation. The Rayquaza machine blew into burning wires and smoking junk.

“WHAT. DID. I. SAY. ABOUT. GAMBLING?!” Dragapult yelled, voice sharp and echoing.

Mr. Mime peeked around the corner—and immediately turned ghost white when he saw Dragapult cracking his claws.

“NO REFUNDS?! I’LL SHOW YOU NO REFUNDS!!”

Pikachu slowly backed into the shadows, mop in hand. “Yyyep. I quit.”


----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


Chapter: Rayquasa's 3rd Life Pt.5


From the shattered debris and smoking wires, a flicker of eerie light sparked—the broken core of the RayBot whirred weakly to life. With an awkward, flickering noise, the weakened form of Rayquaza emerged again—not majestic, but pitiful. Its once-mighty serpentine form now hunched, its scales cracked, and instead of power, it held a pathetic pile of scammed coins and junk in its trembling claws.

“P-please,” the Rayquaza wheezed, eyes dull and twitching. “Just… one more spin… You could win… RARE!!!”

Dragapult stared down at it with disgust.

“You begging to scam me again? Are you even listening to yourself?” he growled.

The Dreepies hovered behind him nervously.

Rayquaza trembled more, clutching the coins like a desperate MLM huckster trying to sell "powerful investment plans" to toddlers.

With one swift movement, Dragapult snatched all the coins back from Rayquaza’s claws. “This belongs to my kids.”

Mr. Mime peeked from the ruins of his alley booth, utterly stunned. “Wait—he was… really alive?! I thought that was just corrupted gacha AI code!!”

Rayquaza collapsed, shaking, still trying to scam the dirt and rocks around him. “Free… spins… Limited… offer…”

Dragapult leaned in close. “I’m not even gonna finish you. Starve.”

He turned away, leaving Rayquaza slumped in the gutter, drooling over his own scam posters, too weak to even stand. The legendary dragon continued whispering fake offers to nobody in particular, like a broken street performer long past relevance, slowly fading out in the way all pyramid schemes do—alone, hungry, and pathetically forgotten.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


Chapter: Rayquasa's 3rd Life Pt.6

Mime, moving with unsettling calm and efficiency, wheeled Rayquaza’s twitching body into Blissey’s general care hospital, humming a tune that didn’t match the dire state of his "patient." Blissey, ever the cheerful and nurturing nurse, gasped in sympathy.

“Oh dear, poor dragon! Malnourished, delusional, and looks like he hasn’t had a real friend in eons! Let’s fix you up, sweetie!”

She administered a full heal—soft-boiled treatments, aromatherapy, and even a Max Revive smoothie on the house. Rayquaza’s eyes lit up—literally—but rather than gratitude, he immediately hissed, “CONGRATS! You’ve won an EXCLUSIVE—”

Snap!

Mime silently raised one finger and flicked a microchip remote in his palm. Rayquaza’s eyes glazed, the scam pitch stalling mid-sentence. With a quiet mechanical beep, Rayquaza stood perfectly still.

“Good boy,” Mime whispered.

With eerie precision, Rayquaza turned, bowed politely to Blissey, and stood like a loyal pet next to Mime, now following commands like a trained Meowth.

Blissey blinked in confusion. “Oh! That was fast. Uh... you two take care now, alright?”

Mime only nodded, tossing a satchel of real coins on the counter. “For the treatment. Keep the change.”

Then without a word, he exited the hospital, a now obedient Rayquaza slithering quietly behind him like some deactivated gacha ghost turned personal assistant.


----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUICIDE ATTEMPT WARNING... only in flashbacks at least...


Chapter: Watery and Rocky Pasts Pt.1

Umbreon, the observant head doctor, reviewed security footage late into the night. With narrowed eyes, he scribbled in his private medical journal:

| “Subject: Mr. Mime — manipulative but composed.
| Rayquaza — unstable, potentially recidivist.
| Blissey — overly trusting; must revise emergency healing protocol.
| Action: Warn my son. Reinforce anti-manipulation safeguards.”

He closed the journal with a sigh. "This city never sleeps... neither should my guard."

-

Meanwhile, in the cozy corners of the indie game during the spooky Halloween event, the three young Kanto Eevee kids gathered in Vaporeon's in-game hideout. A digital fireplace flickered, casting warm light as eerie Lavender Town music softly echoed in the background.

Vaporeon sat across from Flareon and Jolteon, her expression turning nostalgic.

| “You guys ever wonder how I ended up here? In this game, in this city?”

Jolteon tilted his head. “Uh, besides being awesome?”

Flareon shrugged. “You never really told us your story.”

Vaporeon smiled wistfully and began:

| “My parents weren’t from here. They were both born in Sinnoh as Eevees— Mom, Glaceon now, always dreamed of engineering ice tech to help cool cities during power cuts. Dad— he’s Leafeon now— was this super nerdy botanist. Obsessed with plant DNA and making sustainable food. While studying, they met a Unovan exchange student— Zorua, who later became Zoroark, a bounty huntress.”

She continued as the others leaned in, curious.

| “Eventually, my parents moved here together. Zoroark helped them settle down but kept working on her own path. On the voyage here, they traveled by sea and bonded with Lapras and Suicune. That bond changed everything.”

Her tone grew heavy.

| “Years later, Suicune hit a financial crisis. She was moments away from jumping off a rooftop. My parents just happened to be nearby. Dad quickly grew a cushioning layer of moss and vines, and Mom curved an ice ramp to slow her fall. They saved her life.”

Jolteon’s eyes widened. “No way...”

| “Yeah. After that, Suicune joined Mom’s ice cream shop. She worked hard, healed emotionally. Then, one day... I was just a kid, standing outside the shop, holding a waffle cone way too big for me. Suicune gave me the Water Stone herself. That’s when I became Vaporeon.”

Flareon nodded with admiration. “Your parents are real MVPs.”

Vaporeon chuckled softly. “They are my real parents. By blood. Mom is Glaceon, the part-time ice cream engineer, and Dad is Leafeon, the nerdy plant researcher. They raised me with care, science, and snacks. Zoroark was just a close family friend— practically an aunt.”

Flareon looked surprised. “Wait, so your ice powers aren’t just from evolution? You were literally raised in cold tech?”

“Pretty much,” Vaporeon smirked. “I grew up between ice cream machines and greenhouses. Kind of a weird childhood, but it shaped who I am.”

Jolteon nodded. “That’s kinda epic, not gonna lie.”

Vaporeon leaned back with a warm, proud look. “Yeah… they saved a legendary once, but for me? They gave me everything.”


----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Chapter: Watery and Rocky Pasts Pt.2

Jolteon grinned slyly, starting to quote, “Did you know in terms of—”
Only to get instantly muted by Vaporeon, who smacked the mute key in pure panic.

“Don’t you dare finish that cursed sentence in this sacred storytime,” she hissed, face redder than Flareon’s fur.

Meanwhile, Espeon, secretly logged into the game under her PsychicPrincess alias, smiled faintly from her library desk, watching the trio. She decided now was the time to share her own story.

-

“When your Uncle Umbreon and I were young,” Espeon began through the in-game voice chat, startling the kids, “we had a close friend. A Larvitar. Back then, we were all just misfits.”

Espeon’s tone grew more reflective. “Larvitar was shy but loyal. When he evolved into Pupitar, the other kids mocked his awkward form. Ugly, they said. Cold, stiff. But Umbreon and I never left his side.”

“Uncle Umbreon?” Flareon asked. Not sure why his mom called his dad "Uncle". But that saves for his non-blood related friends.

“He studied the stars,” Espeon explained. “The moon guided him. While I learned through the light of the day. That’s how we evolved—by finding our strengths, in different ways.”

She paused. “Pupitar watched us change and shine. And eventually, he did too. Into Tyranitar.”

The room went quiet.

“…He loved me,” Espeon admitted. “Too much. In a way that forgot I had choices. He thought… because we were close, and because I’d stayed kind, that I owed him something.”

The trio stayed silent. The mood had shifted.

“Back then, Tinkaton was still in law school. She tried to defend me when things got scary. Tyranitar, angry from rejection—both from me and from Tinkaton—went rogue. He kidnapped me, tried to force his childhood fantasy into something real.”

“But,” Espeon added calmly, “I broke free. With Umbreon’s help. And… I kept going.”

There was a pause.

Then Vaporeon whispered, “…I had no idea.”

“I didn’t tell many,” Espeon said softly. “But I tell you now, so you understand—kindness doesn’t mean you owe anyone your life.”


----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Chapter: Watery and Rocky Pasts Pt.3

Espeon continued, her voice steady but distant.

"Ho-Oh was there too. A rare sight even then— he soared above that day, witnessing everything from the sky. He didn't interfere, but… he remembered."

Then, as the scene in the game’s memory sequence flickered, another image emerged.

Pikachu.

Back then, not the reckless slapstick mess the kids knew today, but a younger, scrappier Pikachu—part of a group of bandits causing chaos around the outskirts of town. Tyranitar had recruited him, promising power and loot in exchange for loyalty.

“But Pikachu wasn’t like the others,” Espeon said. “He was stupid, impulsive, but he had a heart. When the plan to take me went too far, Pikachu hesitated. He couldn’t watch.”

-

And then Pikachu was starving in the streets and saved by Umbreon, 
hence bounce back to the events of the first chapters, she told them everthing that happened... yup....

-

“After all that,” Espeon said, “Pikachu left the gang. He owed Umbreon his life. That’s why, no matter how stupid or chaotic he gets now… he’s never truly crossed us.”

The kids sat stunned.

Even Jolteon stayed quiet.

Vaporeon finally whispered, “So… that’s why Uncle Umbreon’s so strict sometimes.”

Flareon nodded. “And why Mom keeps her distance from Tyranitar.”

“You’re learning,” Espeon said with a warm smile.


----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Chapter: Luck of Love Pt.1

Now, flash-forward to today:

Tinkaton, no longer just the iconic judge but now a notorious courtroom celebrity, finally ran into Ttar again—this time in his golden executive suite surrounded by WarioWare memorabilia and gold-plated chicken statues. She paused at the door, stunned by how rich he looked now.

Ttar sipped his smoothie with three assistants fanning him from different directions. "Well well, if it isn't the bonker judge herself."

Tinkaton smirked. "You're richer than I imagined, stone-boy. Still single?"

"...Technically." Ttar leaned forward, curious.

Tinkaton, without hesitation, plopped onto his gold beanbag chair across him and raised an eyebrow. "Ever thought of a serious partner? One that doesn't just throw themselves at your feet, but actually bonks you into being real?"

Ttar blinked. "That sounds slightly violent... but also kinda hot."

Tinkaton leaned closer. “Then marry me.”

Silence.

Ttar leaned back. "I—uh..." The confident air cracked just a little. “Marriage... huh. That’s a lot.”

He thought of his current life: wild, chaotic, indulgent, and free. A sudden marriage with Tinkaton? It would be intense. Maybe even... limiting? Or would it just fuel a new kind of power duo?

He looked back at her—waiting, proud, hammer in hand, unflinching.

And for once, the CEO of chaos wasn’t sure.


----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Chapter: Luck of Love Pt.2

Tinkaton wasn’t one to wait on uncertainty. If Ttar wouldn’t say yes, she’d make the entire situation say yes.

One week later…

The WarioWare building was shut down temporarily—not for maintenance, but for an emergency wedding event. Tyranitar’s entire harem stood awkwardly as Judge Tinkaton descended the stairs wearing a wedding dress fused with courtroom robes and a war skirt, hammer decorated in white ribbons.

“Ladies,” she said with a sly grin, “relax. I’m not taking your man… I’m just joining the party.”

Gasps echoed through the golden hallway. Ttar’s smoothie nearly slipped from his claws.

Tinkaton stepped right up to the frozen CEO and gently bonked his head with the tip of her ribbon-wrapped hammer. “Polygamy clause. Approved. I'm not just here for you, I’m here to stabilize your entire legal chaos.”

One of the harem girls blinked. “Wait… can she do that?”

Another whispered, “I think she just did.”

Ttar’s face turned several shades of emerald. “This… might be illegal in three regions.”

Tinkaton twirled her hammer. “Good thing I rewrote the marriage code last night. And no one here’s objecting.”

Silence.

Then one of the Roserade baristas nervously raised a vine. “Can I get in on this if I bake a cake?”

Tinkaton grinned. “Polygamy. Remember?”

And just like that, the papers were filed, the headlines exploded, and Tyranitar—the once-rejected bandit—was now legally married to Judge Tinkaton and his harem. He became what many would soon call:

“The Absolute Lucky Bastard of the Decade.”


----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


Chapter: Luck of Love Pt.3

Detective Gardevoir stared at the live news feed with a look of elegant disbelief, her psychic aura flickering slightly. She blinked twice at the image of Tinkaton in full bridal war-gear, Ttar buried under a mountain of affection, ribboned legal documents, and homemade harem bouquets.

“…What the actual multiverse…” she muttered, setting her teacup down with perfect posture. Then sighed, picked it up again, and calmly sipped.

Lucario, her husband, sat beside her on the couch, arms crossed, but eyes glued to the screen. “…I mean. He is rich. And somehow… stable? I dunno.”

“He was a bandit, Lucario.”

“And now he’s a husband… like ten times over.”

Across the station’s open room, General Machamp— half suited, half shirtless as usual— poked his head in, caught a glance of the screen, and just cracked a grin. “Well I’ll be damned… Lucky bastard! Congrats to the rock pile!”

Lucario raised his mug. “To the rock pile.”

Gardevoir just shook her head, sipping again. “This world makes less and less sense the longer I stay married to you.”

“Yup,” Lucario replied without missing a beat. “But at least we only have one wedding photo.”

Just as the bizarre wedding aftermath was settling into public consciousness, the broadcast abruptly glitched and cut to a new scene: a corrupted digital overlay, static hissing, and then—Mr. Mime’s twisted grin stretched unnaturally across the screen.

“Ladies and gentlemen… it's time to play for love!” he cackled, dragging a battered and bridal-bound Tinkaton into view, now trapped inside a glass capsule shaped like a premium gacha ball. Behind her stood Rayquasa, strings of digital code and puppet threads hanging from his limbs—his eyes blank, shimmering with mind control.

The camera panned to Tyranitar, now stripped of his suit jacket and standing in a forced digital colosseum of slot machines, all spinning with brutal odds. “One in ten thousand chance,” Mime sneered. “Care to gamble for your bride?”

Tyranitar stared for a moment. Then he clenched his fists, cracked his neck, and without hesitation roared—charging forward and smashing through the entire gambling rig in sheer brute force. The machines exploded into coin rain, the glass capsule shattered, and Rayquasa, barely able to scream, was obliterated for the third time— this time torn in half mid-air by a meteorite punch.

Blood sprayed in digital arcs. Tinkaton was scooped from the chaos mid-fall, bridal gown still intact, into Tyranitar’s arms. He walked through the flames, bridal-carrying her like an absolute juggernaut of destiny.

Back at the station, Gardevoir spilled her tea and clutched her chest. “That... was actually romantic.”

Lucario’s jaw dropped. “Romantic? He just ripped open a god again!”

Machamp from the side, chewing popcorn: “Dude’s a walking anime ending. Respect.”

Elsewhere, the breaking news flashed across phones and screens. Espeon, sipping lavender tea in her library, smiled softly. “I’m happy for them. He finally found his crowd.”

Umbreon, watching over her shoulder, grunted in satisfaction. “At least the gacha menace is dead. Again.”

Chapter: Luck of Love Pt.5

As the earth still trembled from Tyranitar’s wrathful rescue across the city, the shockwaves rippled outward, unnoticed by most—except by two students on their way back from school.

Vaporeon and Flareon were walking across the old wooden bridge near the riverside park, their school uniforms fluttering slightly in the breeze. Vaporeon’s pleated skirt swayed lightly while Flareon, in long pants and half-zipped jacket, was mid-sentence when a tremor hit. A deep rumble echoed through the bridge’s beams.

The boards cracked and lurched.

Flareon lost his footing with a startled yell —“Wha—!”— and before he could react, the quake tilted the bridge just enough to toss him over the railing.

“Flareon!” Vaporeon cried, immediately dropping her school bag and vaulting over the side after him with a perfect dive.

He flailed helplessly, gasping, clearly unable to swim. Panic hit hard— until a cool surge of water wrapped around him.

Vaporeon surfaced beneath him with practiced ease, scooping him into her arms as she tread water. Bridal style.

“Relax, I’ve got you,” she whispered, calm but firm, kicking smoothly toward the shore.

He blushed deeply, coughing and clutching onto her as if clinging to life itself. “T-Thanks…”

But the moment their feet touched solid ground, Vaporeon didn’t even wait for his breath to steady—she leaned forward and kissed him right there, while still holding him bridal-style.

His eyes widened, his face now redder than his fur. “Wha— Vaporeon!?”

She smirked playfully, flicking her fin. “You looked like you needed a bit more rescue.”

From the bushes nearby, unseen, Espeon watched with a slight smile. “Teen drama in bloom. As long as they don’t awaken a Legendary again, I’ll allow it.”

Chapter: Luck of Love Pt.6

Meanwhile, somewhere deep in a shady underground server room lit only by glitchy RGB lights and the faint whir of overworked GPUs, Mime panicked—sweating bullets as the last screen showed “WANTED: FRAUDULENT GAMBLING TECH” with Blaziken’s flaming police insignia blazing in the corner.

“Not again...!” he muttered, slamming his keyboard, before slipping into the maintenance shafts and narrowly avoiding capture by Blaziken’s emergency detection drones that scanned the area for any trace of his signature code.

With nowhere left to run and most of his funds drained from Rayquasa repairs and hush money, Mime had one last desperate idea: crank out the crappiest NFT-based gacha mobile game imaginable. He launched “TIMI TIMMY: Crypto Chaos” in less than 72 hours.

The game was pure shovelware—graphics made of stretched stock Pokémon art, dialogue generated from broken machine translations, and a “player base” consisting of barely-tuned chatbots pretending to be global users. The reviews were hilariously fake: “Best NFT ever, changed my life! - PikachuFan420”

Unfortunately, even in this world of absurdity, karma catches up.

Three months later, with the crypto crash, server costs skyrocketing, and not a single whale left willing to buy a 0.0000001% “Shiny Suicune Token,” Mime watched in horror as his profits went negative.

Broke and blacklisted, Mime had no choice.

He reapplied as a janitor under Ttar’s WarioWare division.

Now he mops floors near vending machines, scowling every time he hears someone say “gacha” in the hallway, while posters of his own failed game mock him from the recycle bin.

Ttar passes by once in a while and just mutters, “You should’ve stuck to circus work.”

Chapter: Peaceful Romance Pt.1

Umbreon secretly created an indie game account under the alias ShadowKnightPrince, teaming up with his wife Espeon—known in-game as PsychicPrincess. Together, they explored the world of the quirky, growing game as a duo, with Umbreon maining a tank + healer combo to support her gracefully devastating psychic DPS build. The two coordinated well, bonding deeper as a couple both in and out of the game without their son knowing. They enjoyed playing during late nights, whispering strategies over tea while sharing blankets.

-

One day, Galarian Rapidash, the lead dev of the game, announced the long-awaited Valentine's Event: a full in-game marriage system complete with free bridal carry pose access for real-life couples. While Sableye was excited, Gengar was bitter they had missed the spooky Trick or Treat with Traps Halloween event rerun. Meanwhile, Tsareena at her desk received a mysterious floating love letter—sent telekinetically by a nervous Trevenant. Before she could open it, Gengar snatched it midair and read it aloud mockingly. Seconds later, he got a devastating crotch kick from Tsareena. “Worth it,” he wheezed out while curled up. Sableye chuckled beside him, shrugging. Watching this unfold through the game dev logs, Galarian Rapidash just smiled warmly, whispering: “Friendship truly is magic.”

-

That night, Umbreon proudly bridal-carried Espeon both in-game and then again in real life, recreating the pose for a Valentine’s photo they kept private. But right after, both of them noticed something familiar happening nearby: outside their house, near the backyard pool, Vaporeon was hauling their soaked son Flareon out of the water— bridal style— still dressed in their school uniforms. Apparently, Flareon had slipped and almost drowned during a clumsy evening hangout.

In-game, the exact same pose was happening between their avatars too, thanks to the event auto-sync tied to couple accounts.

Espeon blinked at the scene, then calmly sipped her tea. “Our son is just as much a damsel as I used to be.”

Umbreon groaned under his breath. “This timeline just gets more cursed.”

Chapter: Peaceful Romance Pt.2

The game’s playerbase suddenly spiked with four notable new users:

- Tyranitar joined under the name RockZillaMan,

- Tinkaton created her profile as PikoPikoBonky,

- Gardevoir logged in gracefully as LadyKnightFairy,

- and Lucario reluctantly entered the world under FurrnubisFist.

All four entered the Valentine’s event, mostly for curiosity— or peer pressure.

Soon enough, Tyranitar was seen bridal-carrying Tinkaton both in-game and irl, proudly parading her through the manor gardens and pixel dreamscapes, unaware of what was happening just across the server.

Nearby, the cop couple Gardevoir and Lucario had ended up doing the reverse— Gardevoir was bridal-carrying Lucario, both irl and in-game. It was the result of a private bet Lucario had lost (one that involved spicy curry, reaction time tests, and a failed arm wrestle).

He sighed, flustered. "I can't believe you made this public."

Gardevoir simply winked, floating him effortlessly in her arms. “A bet is a bet. Besides, you look cute in my arms, officer.”


----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Chapter: Peaceful Romance Pt.3

Leafeon and Glaceon happened to pass by the in-game Valentine’s plaza and spotted their daughter Vaporeon bridal-carrying Flareon—both in-game and shown live through the school’s event feed. Leafeon blinked.
“She’s... way stronger than I expected.”
Glaceon smirked. “Told you that hydration training would pay off.”

Meanwhile, Sylveon was dragging Jolteon by the ear toward another round of detention for "electric scooter misuse during indoor lunch hours." On their way, they froze— eyes locking onto the scene of Vaporeon carrying Flareon like a romantic drama heroine. Sylveon grinned.
“Well, looks like your bro friend found someone who can carry his weight.”
Jolteon, red-faced, had no words— only sparks. Absol, who had wandered nearby again, peeked at the scene... then turned around slowly, sighing in silent existential defeat.

-

Suddenly, a loud VROOOOM echoed through the scene. Motorbike Taximan Miraidon made his entrance, wheels sparking the concrete with futuristic flair. He screeched to a stylish halt as Blaziken flagged him down.

Blaziken pointed urgently.
“Miraidon, I need a ride— Mime's robbing banks again. Pikachu tipped us off.”

Without a word, Miraidon let Blaziken hop on, and together they launched into high speed pursuit. They leapt clean over Sylveon and Jolteon, who barely ducked in time.

As Miraidon sped off into the distance, sirens echoing behind, Sylveon muttered, “This week’s been wild.”

Jolteon whispered back, “...And it’s only Tuesday.”

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Chapter: Peaceful Romance Pt.4


Absol, still the quiet guardian type, eventually circled back and offered a single solemn nod toward Vaporeon and Flareon— his own version of a congratulations. Vaporeon smiled faintly in return, still holding Flareon’s hand protectively. Flareon blushed and tried to act cool. Key word: tried.

Meanwhile, Jolteon, electrified with adrenaline after seeing Miraidon's insane entrance, clenched his paws.
“That’s it. I wanna be cool like that.”

Without warning, he charged forward and caught up with Miraidon and Blaziken mid-chase. His own lightning-speed synced with Miraidon’s boosters, doubling the velocity.

Sylveon, watching from behind, blinked in disbelief. “WTF just happened?”

Together, Jolteon, Miraidon, and Blaziken cornered Mime near an alley. Mime tried to throw a gacha NFT folder at them, but Blaziken kicked it into orbit.
Jolteon delivered a final paralyzing zap as Miraidon skidded into a perfect stop, trapping Mime under a neon No Parking sign.

As Mime whimpered something about “royalties,” Jolteon stood tall, panting, then grinned.
“I think I found my dream job... I wanna be a cop.”

Blaziken gave him a solid nod. “Then welcome to the martial patrol, rookie.”

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Chapter: Peaceful Romance Pt.5


Mime was hauled into the courtroom once again—though this time, it looked different. No longer the chaotic budget court filled with flickering lights and vending machine chairs. This was a grand hall—polished marble floors, velvet banners embroidered with the Tinkaton crest, and rows of actual, respectable seats filled with an intrigued, supportive audience. The entire renovation funded by genuine fans and ethical monetization from the booming WarioWare company—not gacha scams, but real love for games.

At the judge’s podium, Tinkaton descended from a crystal staircase, now wearing a luxurious princess-judge hybrid dress, glittering with gemstones and wielding her custom ceremonial bonk hammer. Tyranitar, dressed in a tailored bodyguard suit, stood firmly at her side— just in case Mime tried another “coin-flip incident.”

Mime gulped.

Bonk.

“Do you know why you’re here?” Tinkaton asked, sweetly intimidating.

Bonk.

Mime whimpered, “Sorry... I mean— yes, Your...Princess Honorable Bonkness... ma’am.”

Bonk.

Applause from the audience.

After several more humble bonks and a forced public apology, Mime was sentenced— not to prison— but to community service at the Tyranitar Manor. Now as an underpaid butler, he found himself polishing imported floors and serving tea to Tyranitar's five girlfriends. He muttered daily about “wasted potential,” but every time he slacked, a framed picture of Tinkaton's bonk hammer glared at him from the wall.
