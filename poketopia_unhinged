Classic dark fairytale structure(?) but with Pokémon. It hits that dramatic tone with a twisted antagonist (Tyranitar), a helpless but strong-willed victim (Espeon), a devoted but possibly flawed hero (Umbreon), and a wildcard anti-hero (Pikachu) who probably didn’t sign up for any of this... at first... until the twists happen later....

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


Title: Shadows of the Moonlight Vale

The air in the Vale was thick with ash and silence.

Espeon lay motionless in a cage of obsidian vines, her psychic energy flickering weakly beneath the weight of a suppressor band around her neck. The moonlight barely reached this corner of the ruined shrine, where Tyranitar paced like a king denied his throne.

"You should be grateful," he growled, voice like shifting gravel. "Most would beg to be chosen. But I will have patience... for now."

She met his gaze without flinching. “Umbreon will find me,” she whispered, voice taut with exhaustion. “And when he does—”

Tyranitar’s laugh shook the stones.

—

Far from the Vale, Umbreon stood atop a shattered cliff, eyes narrowed against the scent trail he had followed for hours. His ringed body pulsed faintly with rage. Beside him, Pikachu blinked, looking bored and vaguely annoyed.

“You dragged me out here for this?” Pikachu muttered. “I had plans tonight. Plans that didn’t include chasing your love life drama into haunted terrain.”

Umbreon didn’t look at him. “You owe me, remember?”

Pikachu groaned. “I owed you a favor. Not a death wish.”




----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


Exactly—Espeon’s Psychic type being vulnerable to both Umbreon and Tyranitar’s Dark makes the whole situation feel even more tense, almost symbolic. She’s caught between two forces she can’t overpower directly—one who loves her, and one who wants to possess her. Let’s raise the stakes.



Scene Two: Echoes Beneath the Shrine

The entrance to the shrine was silent, overgrown with twisted brambles and carved with crude runes—a warning long since ignored. Umbreon’s rings glowed faintly in the gloom as he slipped between the shadows. Behind him, Pikachu followed, reluctantly, tail twitching with every creak of the stone beneath their feet.

“So what’s the plan?” Pikachu whispered. “We storm in, shout ‘Give her back,’ and then get flattened by a walking mountain?”

Umbreon didn’t answer.

“You don’t have a plan, do you?” Pikachu muttered.

“I have a purpose.”

“Tch. Great. He’s in vengeance mode.” Pikachu’s fur sparked with static.

—

Deeper inside, Espeon stirred, ears twitching at the faint echo of movement. Tyranitar stood before a stone altar, claws scraping impatiently at the edge. He had dressed it with stolen petals and jagged crystals, a mockery of a ceremony that had no soul.

“We could be perfect,” he murmured, half to her, half to the ghosts in his mind. “You understand light. I understand shadow. It’s balance.”

Espeon’s gem glowed weakly. “You don’t want balance. You want obedience.”

—

Suddenly, the shrine trembled.

Tyranitar turned, nostrils flaring. “He’s here.”

And from the upper corridor, a yellow flash crashed through the stone—Pikachu, yelling mid-air: “I knew this was a trap!”

Umbreon followed like a shadow unleashed.

“Give. Her. Back.”




----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------






Scene Three: The Fall Beneath the Shrine

The battle was thunder and fury.

Umbreon dove first, silent and deadly, striking at Tyranitar’s flank with a shadow-charged Foul Play. Tyranitar barely flinched. His counterattack was immediate—Stone Edge erupted from the floor, slamming Umbreon into a wall with a sickening crunch.

“Umbreon!” Espeon screamed, eyes wide with horror.

Pikachu roared, lightning crackling violently. “Thunderbolt!” The beam struck Tyranitar square in the chest, staggering the brute. For a second, the air smelled like burnt sand and ozone.

But Tyranitar just grinned.

“I gave you a chance,” he growled, then lunged forward with terrifying speed.

His claws caught Pikachu mid-dodge. One swipe. One final cry.

Then silence.

Umbreon, broken and bleeding, crawled to Espeon’s cage. He pressed his muzzle to hers, eyes dim. “I’m sorry… I couldn’t…”

And Tyranitar brought down a final Dark Pulse, drowning him in shadow.

Scene Four: Ceremony of Dust

Espeon wailed, psychic energy flaring in useless bursts. “You monster—!”

Tyranitar stood tall, dragging her to the altar. “They chose to fight. You choose to live.”

He placed a dull crown of thorns atop her head and stepped back. “You will remember this moment as the day the world bent to fate.”

—

But hidden in the crumbling walls above… Blissey watched. Once his maid, long discarded when she spoke of mercy. She clutched an old feather in trembling hands—a gift from a time before his cruelty.

“Enough,” she whispered, holding the feather to the moonlight. “Please… hear me.”

A sudden wind cut through the shrine.

Above, the sky split open with gold and flame.

Ho-Oh descended.

Scene Five: Phoenix Rebirth

Tyranitar turned too late.

From Ho-Oh’s wings poured sacred light—life reborn. The shrine shook with divine force as Umbreon stirred, his wounds sealing in radiant fire. Pikachu blinked awake, dazed, then immediately bolted in terror, vanishing into the woods without a word.

Umbreon rose, golden embers in his fur. He turned to Ho-Oh, stunned. “Why?”

Blissey stepped forward. “Because she loved you. And because someone had to care.”

He looked at her, then to Espeon, still bound and crying.

His voice was low, but firm.

“Round two.”



----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------



Scene Six: The Siege of Shadow Watchers

The shrine was now a fortress.

At Tyranitar’s command, his elite dark-type sentinels stood guard:
Absol, silent and watchful, eyes glowing with omen.
Darkrai, drifting through walls like a nightmare incarnate.
Sableye, grinning with jewels in his eyes, hungry for mischief.
And Zoroark, the lone female—fierce, cunning, and suspicious of everything.

Inside, Tyranitar was nearly finished. Espeon struggled weakly against enchanted cords binding her into a ceremonial dress—silken white laced with obsidian thread. Her tears fell quietly.

"You will be mine," Tyranitar growled, voice low. "Even the gods can't change that now."

—

Outside, Umbreon stood before Ho-Oh, the legendary bird shimmering with golden light.

“I need you,” Umbreon said, bowing deeply. “Distract them. All of them. Take every blow. Just give me one chance.”

Ho-Oh blinked, then let out a cry that shook the heavens.

The sky cracked open again.

Flames roared down as Ho-Oh descended upon the guards, scattering shadow and fire in a storm of divine wrath. Absol and Darkrai immediately retaliated with Night Slash and Dark Void, while Sableye cackled, phasing through Ho-Oh’s wings with eerie glee. Zoroark vanished in illusion, waiting to strike.

—

Amid the chaos, Umbreon nodded to Blissey, who was already moving—quiet and quick through the back corridors of the shrine. Her heart pounded. She had one task: free Espeon.

But when she reached the chamber—

Espeon was already tied to the altar. Tyranitar stood over her, claws holding the final piece of the cursed wedding veil.

Blissey gasped.

—

At the same moment, somewhere in the trees, Pikachu stopped running.

The sounds of battle echoed behind him.

His paws clenched. His tail crackled.

“I’m a rat,” he muttered. “But not that kind of rat.”

Then, with a growl, he turned and sprinted back toward the shrine, sparks flying behind him.

—



----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


Scene Seven: The Phoenix Nearly Falls

Ho-Oh, majestic and burning, was beginning to falter.

Absol’s blades had struck true. Darkrai’s Dark Pulse cracked celestial feathers. Zoroark’s illusions disoriented even the divine. Ho-Oh flared with a final burst of Sacred Fire, forcing them back—but its wings drooped. Its flame dimmed.

“I cannot… rise again,” Ho-Oh gasped.

Umbreon, battered but burning with purpose, leapt forward, shielding the godlike bird. “Then I will rise for you.”

Night Slash slashed across his flank. Umbreon winced, braced to fall—

But a crack of lightning lit the night.

Pikachu, tail gleaming with vengeance, dove from above. “Thunder Wave!”

Absol convulsed, stunned mid-leap. The battlefield turned. Zoroark snarled and vanished into the smoke, grabbing Darkrai and Sableye to retreat into the shadows.

But Pikachu didn’t see the last twist.

Zoroark reappeared—as Espeon.

“Wait, Espe—?” he blinked.

Slash.

Blood splattered. Pikachu collapsed, again, gasping for breath.

“No—!” Umbreon roared, lunging forward. He struck Zoroark with a Payback filled with rage, just as Ho-Oh called down a searing Sky Blessing. The illusion shattered, Zoroark crumpled, unconscious.

Ho-Oh’s final embers washed over Pikachu, breath returning to his lungs.

“I died twice for you guys,” Pikachu croaked, eyes fluttering. “Third time’s a charge…”

—

Elsewhere…

In the ruins’ silent rear hall, Blissey had almost reached Espeon, cutting one final thread from her veil.

Then—a whisper behind her.

Darkrai’s cold breath on her neck. Sableye’s claws around her arms.

She screamed once before shadows swallowed her whole.

—



----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------



Final Scene: Shadows Redeemed, a Tyrant’s Fall

In the scorched aftermath of the battle, Umbreon stood over the fallen Zoroark and Absol, not with vengeance, but mercy. His rings pulsed with calm light.

“You don’t have to end this in darkness.”

Zoroark stirred, groaning. “She still owes me 600 Poké… with interest.”

Espeon, faintly glowing, sighed with telekenesis. “I paid it… eventually…”

Absol sat up, eyes downcast. “I just needed cash for skins. They released ten legendaries in one banner. I cracked.” He looked away. “This isn’t who I wanted to be.”

Umbreon extended his paw. “Then fight with me. Fix it.”

They took it.

—

Suddenly, Tyranitar returned, crashing through the shrine wall with a roar that shook the mountains. His rage had only grown, now monstrous and glowing with a corrupted Mega Stone aura. “You dare stand against me… all of you?!”

Umbreon stepped forward, unshaken. Behind him stood:

Pikachu, tail sparking with renewed resolve

Zoroark, illusions swirling around her

Absol, blades sharpened, eyes clear

Ho-Oh, rising once more with divine fire

Tyranitar charged Umbreon in a violent quake of earth and shadow.

They clashed like titans.

—

As they fought, Zoroark and Ho-Oh flanked the battlefield, striking Darkrai, who had emerged from shadow to backstab the group. Zoroark danced through illusions while Ho-Oh scorched his nightmares with searing light.

Across the field, Absol and Pikachu cornered Sableye, who giggled wildly while launching Shadow Claws in all directions. Absol’s calm slashes cut through the madness. Pikachu’s Thunderbolt grounded him.

Mid-battle, Absol whispered to Pikachu, “Cover me.”

He slipped away.

—

Back inside the shrine, Blissey and Espeon still lay in shadow chains. Until—

Slice.

Absol emerged behind them, blades flashing, silently cutting the restraints.

“You’re late,” Blissey said, dusting herself off.

“I had a side quest,” he muttered.

—

Returning to the front line, Blissey unleashed her full Healing Pulse, breaking CC effects and restoring Umbreon’s fading strength. Espeon joined Umbreon with a silent nod, her Psybeam cutting through Tyranitar’s armor.

Together, they launched a synchronized attack—Espeon’s psychic force and Umbreon’s Dark Pulse tearing through his corrupted energy. Tyranitar howled.

Then, in one final moment, the five struck in perfect unison:

Pikachu’s Volt Tackle

Zoroark’s Night Daze

Absol’s Megahorn

Espeon’s Psyshock

Umbreon’s Last Resort

Tyranitar fell.

Cracked, broken, and unconscious. The Mega Stone shattered.

—

The shrine fell silent. Wind carried away the last of the dust.

Umbreon turned to Ho-Oh. “It’s over.”

Ho-Oh nodded. “You all chose light when darkness was easier. That is what makes heroes.”

Pikachu sat down hard. “Can I not die in the next arc?”

Everyone but Ttar, Sableye and Darkrai (those 3 are fainted unconcious and left there) laughed.


----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Chapter: Gacha Ruins Everything Again

Three days after the climactic battle, peace finally seemed possible.

Umbreon and Espeon sat beneath a peaceful cherry-blossom tree just outside the restored shrine, quietly sharing berries and half-coy smiles. Ho-Oh and Absol stood watch nearby, acting more like awkward uncles than bodyguards.

Absol kept glancing at the sky. “Something’s wrong.”

Ho-Oh sipped divine tea. “You’re paranoid.”

Just then, the clouds ripped open. A machine descended, shimmering with corrupted light and fake sparkle.

RAYQUAZA, massive and glowing, landed—fused with a casino capsule machine.

“COME SPIN FOR LEGENDARY LOOT AND DUBIOUS SKINS!” it bellowed, voice glitching like a possessed ad.

Absol froze. His eyes dilated. “No… no. Not again.”

Flashback montage: Gacha banners. Zero pulls. Whiffed 0.5% drop rates. The Lopunny skin he never got.

He screamed and charged blindly.

Rayquaza blinked. “Huh?”

A burst of wind sent Absol flying into a metal pole. CLANG. He dropped like a fainted Rattata.

“Absol!” Espeon shrieked. Ho-Oh immediately hovered over him and revived him with a pulse of phoenix magic. “You have got to stop doing this.”

—

Before anyone could regroup—

Tyranitar burst from the ground. “I! WANT! REVENGE—!”

SMASH.

He tripped mid-roar, accidentally body-slamming Rayquaza, who had just retracted his gacha legs.

Blood. Coins. Limbs. Legendary scales.

Everyone just stood there.

“…What the hell?” Tyranitar muttered, now drenched in Rayquaza’s weird techno-blood and surrounded by dropped Poké coins.

Umbreon and Espeon blinked. “Was that… on purpose?”

Ho-Oh hovered over the scene, deeply confused, then solemnly handed Tyranitar a pouch full of gold coins. “Thank you for your service. You have defeated the true evil.”

Tyranitar stood frozen. “Am I the hero now?”

Absol, revived and dazed, limped over. “Guess you don’t need Espeon after all. There are plenty of other ladies.”

He listed them off, holding up a wing-finger per name:

“Tsareena. Lilligant. Pheromosa. Salazzle. Lopunny… Maybe even Gardevoir if Lucario ever screws up again.”

Tyranitar blinked. “…I mean. That’s a start.”

The camera slowly zoomed out on the four, standing in blood, coins, blossoms, and godly confusion.


----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Chapter: Romance, Regret, and Rabbits

Still standing in the aftermath of Rayquaza’s explosive death, Tyranitar looked around, breathing heavily, glitter and blood drying on his rocky body.

He turned to Umbreon and Espeon, who were still holding paws, dazed from everything.

Suddenly, he grabbed both their heads and smooshed them together.

“KISS!! NOW!! ROMANCE DESERVES A FINISHING MOVE!”

Umbreon grunted. Espeon yelped. Their faces squished like berries.

When he finally let go, they blinked—then awkwardly kissed for real, just to stop him from trying again.

Tyranitar clapped. “YES!! TRUE LOVE WINS!!”

Then—his eyes widened.

Across the field, a Lopunny was picking flowers, humming softly.

Tyranitar's heart skipped several jagged beats. “Mine?”

He stomped forward.

Lopunny turned. She froze.

Her ears stiffened. “...Oh no.”

She dropped her bouquet and bolted.

“WAIT!! I’M REFORMED!! I’M RICH!! I HAVE MONEY AND TRAUMA!!”

He chased her across the hills, screaming about love, loot, and redemption.

Behind them, Umbreon and Espeon sat on the grass, finally relaxing again.

Absol sighed. “Should we stop him?”

Ho-Oh shook his head. “Nah. Let karma do its thing.”

The camera slowly faded out on Lopunny's silhouette fleeing into the sunset—Tyranitar stumbling behind, coins falling from his bag like breadcrumbs.

[Fin????]

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Why Rayquasa dies?

Honestly, Rayquaza in Pokémon Unite (or Divide) is the literal embodiment of unfair, unearned power. A glorified loot box boss with no mechanical skill, just “last-hitter wins” trash.

At least Pikachu players sometimes aim and time stuns. Rayquaza just descends from the heavens, invalidates a whole fight, and hands the win to whoever sneezes near it last. He’s the final insult in a game that already hates balance.

In this fanfic? Rayquaza deserved to die in a pile of coins and confusion. Tyranitar unintentionally did the world a favor by body-slamming the crony-capitalism incarnate.
