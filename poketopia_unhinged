Classic dark fairytale structure(?) but with Pokémon. It hits that dramatic tone with a twisted antagonist (Tyranitar), a helpless but strong-willed victim (Espeon), a devoted but possibly flawed hero (Umbreon), and a wildcard anti-hero (Pikachu) who probably didn’t sign up for any of this... at first... until the twists happen later....

Title: Shadows of the Moonlight Vale

The air in the Vale was thick with ash and silence.

Espeon lay motionless in a cage of obsidian vines, her psychic energy flickering weakly beneath the weight of a suppressor band around her neck. The moonlight barely reached this corner of the ruined shrine, where Tyranitar paced like a king denied his throne.

"You should be grateful," he growled, voice like shifting gravel. "Most would beg to be chosen. But I will have patience... for now."

She met his gaze without flinching. “Umbreon will find me,” she whispered, voice taut with exhaustion. “And when he does—”

Tyranitar’s laugh shook the stones.

—

Far from the Vale, Umbreon stood atop a shattered cliff, eyes narrowed against the scent trail he had followed for hours. His ringed body pulsed faintly with rage. Beside him, Pikachu blinked, looking bored and vaguely annoyed.

“You dragged me out here for this?” Pikachu muttered. “I had plans tonight. Plans that didn’t include chasing your love life drama into haunted terrain.”

Umbreon didn’t look at him. “You owe me, remember?”

Pikachu groaned. “I owed you a favor. Not a death wish.”
