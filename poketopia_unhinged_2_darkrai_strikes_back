Darkrai is the main antagonist in this saga.

Poketopia: Unhinged :: Darkrai Strikes Back

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


Prolouge: 200 years of darkness alone

Just after Darkrai got whack-a-moled by Tinkaton and before Gengar’s redemption…

Darkrai had been asleep for 200 years—but only in a dream, locked inside his own mental prison.
By year 69 of the dream sentence, he began plotting revenge against all Pokémon. His thoughts formed a twisted vision... a company logo:
"TIMI TIMMY Co."

Even in his vengeful haze, Darkrai cringed at the absurdity of the name.
Still, something about it pulled him forward. Using mental energy, he projected himself—far from the city—marking a site for the construction of a Dark Castle Lair, the predicted respawn point of the next gacha-machine.

By year 200, he awakened in the real world. Months passed as he quietly built the castle and conducted obscure research.
And then... it happened.
After Mime’s defeat, and Rayquaza’s third death, the gacha machine respawned—exactly as he foresaw.

But Darkrai wasn’t ready yet.
He spent more months preparing, studying the mechanics, digging through corrupted AI scripts and glitchy summon lore.

Now—after the peace of the beach day fades—Darkrai finally completes the final key: control.
Rayquaza, the scammy dragon, is released again for the fourth time.



-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Prolouge: 4th time's the charm

Rayquaza 4.0 – the MLM Pitcher Supreme

The fourth resurrection of Rayquaza, born from Darkrai’s post-dream recalibration, is no longer the fragile flashy dragon of old.
Rayquaza 4.0 still peddles lootboxes and probability-rigged banners with the fervor of a cult leader at a tech expo—but now, he’s structurally altered.

This version is:

- More resilient to Tyranitar’s one-shot finisher, having been remade with anti-Dark Pulse plating and “plot armor firmware.”

- Built with passive income logic loops, able to auto-sell banners while speaking.

- Still flashy, still loud, but now harder to meme out of existence.

Darkrai stands in the shadows, watching his MLM beast emerge, whispering,

| “This time, the scam is eternal.”

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Chapter: Darkness awakens Pt.1


Rain falls like whispers of dread.
Outskirts of the city—Bounty Hunter Greninja, cloaked in soaked shadows, tightens the scarf around his mouth. His quiet stroll halts as he sees it:
A dark castle, jagged and unnatural, oozing with black-purple energy.

From inside:
A cringeworthy pitch echoes,

| “LIMITED-TIME RAID PACK! DOUBLE THE DROP RATES—TRIPLE THE REGRET!”
| followed by Darkrai’s chilling laugh, warped by years of isolation and ego.

Greninja narrows his eyes. “He’s back…”

Without hesitation, he disappears into a water log mist. He must warn the city—and more importantly, Fortune Teller Delphox, his trusted partner and love.

She saw this coming. She always does.


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Chapter: Darkness awakens Pt.2


Inside Delphox’s warm hutch, candles flicker beside tarot cards and herbal incense.
Tsareena sits across from Delphox, her legs crossed like roots in meditation.

| “If you plant the mangosteen seed with care,” Delphox says gently, “especially during this rainy moon, your harvest will double. Twice the yield. | Twice the coin.”

Tsareena smiles, intrigued—until the door swings open with a sudden burst of wind.

Greninja steps in, dripping with rain, eyes sharp. “He’s back. The dark dreamer.”

Tsareena blinks. “Who?”

Delphox, with no hesitation:

| “Darkrai. He’s building again. And this time… the machine speaks.”

Greninja nods. “The scam-pitch castle’s no illusion. He’s baiting the city.”

Delphox closes her eyes. “There is only one Pokémon who can finish him. Tyranitar’s rocky hands… the prophecy’s final card. But he won’t believe it.”

Tsareena, now uneasy, looks out into the storm. “Then we’re doomed?”

Delphox stands and places a hand on her shoulder. “Not if you stay dry, and keep planting. Destiny favors patience.”

Tsareena, still confused, quietly exits into the rain—mangosteen seed in hand, unsure whether she’s walking away from nonsense or prophecy.


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Chapter: Darkness awakens Pt.3


Back inside the hutch, Delphox traces her wand over a constellation chart.

Greninja watches quietly, arms crossed.

| “You don’t actually see the future,” he mutters. “You calculate possible paths.”

Delphox nods without looking up.

| “Exactly. I glimpse forks in the stream, not the destination. The future isn't fixed—it’s a woven cloth of choices.”

She taps one path in the chart.

| “But the past… I can replay that as many times as I want. Every cause leaves an echo.”

Greninja steps closer, placing a hand on her shoulder.

| “That’s what makes you real. You don’t preach fate—you read patterns.”

Delphox smiles faintly. “And what I see now… is a dark stitch threading the city.”


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


Chapter: Darkness awakens Pt.4


Later that rainy night, two cloaked figures dart through the shadows of the countryside—Ceruledge and his brother Armarouge, twin bandits known for raids on abandoned outposts and forgotten shrines.

Tonight, their eyes are set on something more dangerous: the newly risen Dark Castle.

| “You sure this place ain’t cursed?” Armarouge whispers.

| “Cursed or not, rich weirdos always got relics,” Ceruledge replies, blades flickering faintly in the rain.

Inside, they sneak past the eerie halls… until a thunderous echo halts them.

A voice.
A promise.
A sales pitch.

| “Fortune. Power. No more crumbs.”

They peek past a broken archway and freeze. There it is—Rayquaza, his fourth incarnation, spiraling in place like a mirage—while Darkrai watches from the balcony above, eyes glowing.

| “I knew rats would find their way here,” Darkrai says. “You’re lucky I need rats.”

Ceruledge draws a blade. Armarouge flares with flame—but then the room darkens into a choking haze of shadow.

“Either serve me quietly, or scream and become fertilizer.”

The two exchange glances… and kneel.


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


Chapter: Darkness awakens Pt.5


The next day, inside Delphox’s cozy, lantern-lit hutch, a young couple —Vaporeon and Flaeron— sat nervously before the fortune teller and her partner, Greninja. They had come to ask how to make their upcoming school prom date unforgettable.

Delphox was about to respond warmly, but Greninja entered the room with damp steps and a colder air.

| “We have bigger things to worry about,” he said, nodding to Delphox.

The atmosphere shifted. The fox’s fur bristled slightly as she realized what he meant.

| “It’s about him, isn’t it?” she asked.

Vaporeon, though surprised, tried to ease the mood.

| “You two are like the reverse of us— Firegirl and Waterboy!”

Delphox giggled lightly, tail swaying, but Greninja stayed stoic, gazing toward the stormy skies beyond the window.

Suddenly, the door creaked open, revealing a visitor in a glimmering pink cloak— Wigglytuff, now a beloved celebrity singer, who had overheard from outside.

| “Did someone say Darkrai?”

The room quieted.

| “Tell me everything.”

-

Delphox quietly pulled out her enchanted crystal orb, glowing dim blue under the rain-filtered light. She waved her hand—and the past came alive in a misty vision:

Darkrai, once a shady street corner fortune teller, wearing a crooked monocle and too much flair, once scammed Absol into trusting a fraudulent opportunity— Rayquaza’s first gacha machine. Then came Tyranitar, heartbroken and vulnerable, seeking love advice.

| "Go flirt with the hammer girl," Darkrai had advised slyly.

It ended disastrously. Tinkaton bashed him. Tyranitar raged. He demolished Darkrai’s booth, cursed him out in a storm of vulgarity, and enslaved him, chaining him beside a cage holding Espeon, as penance.

-

The vision faded.

| “Dang,” said Flaeron. “My mom had it rough back then…”

Wigglytuff, visibly shaken, clenched her hands.

| “So he really went that far…”

She turned with resolve. “I’m going to find him.”

Greninja stepped in front of her, arms crossed.

| “You’ll get yourself killed.”

| “We should just tell Tyranitar,” Vaporeon suggested.

Delphox shook her head.

| “He doesn’t listen to fortune tellers anymore.”

Realizing the danger, the eevee couple left to inform their parents.

Meanwhile, Wigglytuff knew who would take her seriously— Gardevoir and Lucario.

Word spread fast. Soon, Wanted Posters were issued:

DARKRAI — HIGH THREAT
CERULEDGE & ARMAROUGE — WANTED DEAD OR ALIVE

On the outskirts of town, bounty flames lit in the distance.
Blaziken, long-time hunter of the twin bandits, cracked his knuckles as he read the posters.

| “Great... dis gonna be fun.”


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


Chapter: Darkness awakens Pt.6


One rainy afternoon, Greninja met up with his old squad— Coach Cinderace and Archer Sniper Decidueye— inside Charizard’s Butcher Grill Restaurant. They gathered at the back booth, far from the bustle of lunchtime.

Greninja pulled out a weathered scroll and unrolled it across the table.
The bold text read: “WANTED: DARKRAI – EXTREMELY DANGEROUS”
Beneath it, the shadowy figure's sinister grin glared back.

Cinderace, casually munching on a peeled carrot, narrowed his eyes.

| “Darkrai, huh? Figures he’d be back. Guy’s pure rot.”
| He looked around at the meat-packed menu and whispered, “Still can't believe you all eat this... I’m vegan, you know.”

Meanwhile, Decidueye picked at a roasted Skiddo skewer, but the moment his eyes caught the poster, he froze mid-chew. His pupils shrank.

| “T-that face…” he stammered, before spitting the meat into a napkin.
| “He almost killed me during the Archery Regionals… snuck up mid-match. If Machamp hadn’t tackled him by accident while jogging, I’d be a memory right now…”

Charizard, who had been grilling in the open kitchen, overheard the conversation while seasoning a slab of Tauros ribs. He turned, lowering his shades.

| “You said Darkrai?” he asked.

Greninja nodded silently and slid one of the posters across the table.

Charizard took it, studied the face, and grunted.

| “Leave me a few copies. If he steps in here— I’m cooking him next.”

Greninja smirked slightly.

| “Don’t undercook him. He’s a tough one.”


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


Chapter: Darkness awakens Pt.7


In the quiet garden behind Glaceon’s manor, the rain had left everything smelling fresh. Leafeon was pruning overgrown mint while Absol, wearing a straw hat a size too small, helped replant some azalea bulbs.

Just then, Vaporeon rushed in, her tail still dripping.

| “You need to be careful,” she said in a low voice. “Darkrai’s back. He’s planning something big.”

Glaceon set down her tea glass.

| “Darkrai? Here? After all this time?”

Absol’s ears twitched. He stood up slowly, wiping dirt from his claws.

| “...I knew it,” he muttered. “I had a feeling the air was off lately.”

They turned to him, surprised.

| “You knew him?” Glaceon asked.

Absol nodded, looking away.

| “A long time ago. I was broke, desperate. Darkrai pitched me this ‘golden investment’ in something called the Rayquasa Resurgence Machine… Said it’d pay out tenfold. It was a lie. I lost everything. My job. My pride. Even my den.”

Leafeon frowned, gently patting Absol’s shoulder.

| “You don’t have to go into it—”

| “No, it’s fine,” Absol cut in. “I need to own that mistake. Just… if he’s really back, don’t trust a single word he says.”

Meanwhile, not far away by a frosted snack cart, Pikachu handed a popsicle to a child Eevee. He had overheard most of it while pretending to refill the cooler.

He sighed, taking a bite of his own berry bar.

| “That mess again? Man, not my circus, not my Rayquasa…”

But his eyes lingered on the garden. He couldn’t quite stop watching.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Chapter: Darkness awakens Pt.8

Back at the city center, a familiar fluffy shape rushed through the wet streets—Flareon, holding a big umbrella that clearly wasn’t his. His tail was soaked, but his paws gripped the handle with purpose.

He burst through the back door of Espeon and Umbreon’s townhouse, water splashing off his fur.

| “Mom! Dad! It’s Darkrai— he’s back!”

Espeon, sipping tea on the couch, stiffened. Her teacup clinked sharply onto the saucer. Her eyes stared ahead, unfocused—memories of that cage… that cold silence…

Umbreon stood immediately, putting an arm around her.
Flareon rushed in close, lowering the umbrella and letting it drip beside the door.

| “I heard it from Vaporeon and Delphox. He’s planning something.”

Umbreon looked grim, nodding.

| “Then we don’t wait. We prepare.”

He kissed Espeon’s forehead softly.

| “I’ll secure the hospital.”

Within the hour, Umbreon had returned to his clinic. Snorlax and Swampert took their stations at the front gates—pillars of unshakable muscle. Clefable, clipboard in hand, quietly activated a series of hidden surveillance runes from the nurse’s station.

Meanwhile, Espeon summoned help to her library. Goodra, gentle but formidable, stationed herself at the rare books wing. Chesnaught held post by the front doors like a knight of old. Duraludon, stoic and silent, monitored the magical field scanner in the atrium.

The once-peaceful city was no longer asleep. It remembered.


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

GORE AND SHIT WARNING!!!


Chapter: Rodent Sh*tstorms


One cloudy afternoon, Darkrai snuck up to Charizard’s restaurant and plopped down a shady-looking arcade machine labeled “DREAM ROULETTE”— all flashy lights, creepy chiptune music, and a giant smiling Rayquaza sticker on it. It hummed with dark energy, but looked just innocent enough to fool a certain curious rodent…

Enter Greedent, off-duty from Tyranitar’s manor and waddling around looking for snacks. He spotted the machine and immediately thought: “Free food dispenser?” He slapped the start button with both paws.

ZAP! The screen flashed, a tiny neon Rayquaza spiraled out and zapped straight into Greedent’s head. Greedent froze, eyes spiraling, then dropped like a sack of potatoes.

Inside his head: two weeks of dreamland chaos. He was a billionaire, king of snacks, emperor of hoarding. But slowly, the dream twisted—his pile of berries turned to stones, fans into angry mob, his crown into a toilet seat.

BAM! He jolted awake, only 5 minutes passed. But now he was screaming about taxes and jellybeans, panicked and dizzy, spinning in circles—then accidentally dropped a massive load right in front of Charizard’s front door.

Charizard walked out, saw the mess, and went full Gordon Ramsay. “ARE YOU KIDDING ME?!”

Greedent squealed and ran away, slipping and skidding across the street— only to get splatted comically into Ceruledge’s passing scooter windshield, leaving a classic cartoon-shaped smear and falling into a trash can with a dramatic CLANG.

Ho-Oh, watching from a rooftop, sighed deeply. “Again?”

He flapped down, resurrected the dizzy Greedent with a sparkle, who blinked and muttered, “...I think I saw bacon in the sky…”

Charizard: “You’re banned. Forever.”

Meanwhile, back at his creepy perch, Darkrai facepalmed and muttered, “This is not how nightmares are supposed to work.” He quietly wheeled out a second machine labeled “VOLUME II: NIGHT TERRORS” and muttered, “Next victim…”

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUICIDE WARNING!!


Chapter: Wilting Haunted Tree Pt.1


Bright sunny morning. Birds chirping, flowers blooming, and in the middle of it all— Trevenant’s haunted-looking garden, where spooky vines curl around cheerful birdbaths and jack-o’-lanterns hum lullabies.

While Trevenant prunes a wailing rose bush, a suspiciously flashy arcade machine sparkles into view beside a crooked stump. It hums, blinks, and flashes: “DREAM ROULETTE—FREE PLAY!”

Trevenant squints. “Huh… that’s… festive?”

He creaks over, presses a viney finger on the button—ZAP! A neon Mini-Rayquaza zaps into his head.

Inside the dream: Trevenant is suddenly rich, tossing golden acorns, Tsareena blowing kisses, paparazzi snapping pics. But just as he poses for a glamour shot—crash! Tsareena dumps him, the crowd boos, and his wallet eats itself. Cue a spiral of rejection, financial ruin, and loneliness.

Five minutes later, real world: Trevenant jolts awake, lets out a slow, "nnnnoooo…", and begins wobbling like a tree in a hurricane.

Then… “Maybe I’m just a spooky shrub with no drip…”

Darkrai, hidden behind a scarecrow, whispers in his head: “Kill urself lol. You’re literally built like a cursed celery stick.”

Trevenant, crushed and spiraling, creaks toward the nearby river and yeets himself in, trying to soak into oblivion—“Overwatering ends it all…”

BUT! Just before full submersion—

Lapras slides in with a tidal wave and catches him on her back.

Suicune runs across the water like an ethereal deer and kicks Trevenant out of the river like a soggy football.

Lapras: “Are you trying to drown in broad daylight?!”

Suicune (stern): “Explain. Now.”

Trevenant, soggy and leaking leaves, points weakly toward the cursed machine still blinking in his garden: “That arcade… thing… lied to me… stole my joy…”

Lapras and Suicune exchange a look.

Suicune: “We’re gonna need river fences and depression sensors.”

Lapras: “And maybe get Slowbro to start a mental health hotline…”

Meanwhile, from a dark cloud above, Darkrai sighs: “Okay, that almost worked… next location: the daycare.”


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


Chapter: Wilting Haunted Tree Pt.2


Scene: A lazy afternoon at the riverside.

Slowbro, reclining in a floaty chair made of logs, sipping coconut juice with a tiny umbrella in it. He's technically on duty as a lifeguard, but mostly napping and muttering things like, "If they don't wanna live, they ain't gonna swim."

Suddenly —SPLOOSH!— Suicune flings a soaked, leaf-drooping Trevenant right past Slowbro’s floaty.

Slowbro blinks once. “...Was that salad trying to drown?”

Five minutes later…

-

Scene: Pokémon Hospital.
Doctor Umbreon, as usual, stands dignified at the front desk, clipboard ready, looking 100% done with everyone’s problems.

Slowbro drags in Trevenant in a wheelbarrow made of driftwood. “Yo, fix him. For free.”

Umbreon (blinks slowly): “You again…”

Tension fills the room.

| Flashback bubble: Two young Pokémon arguing over who gets the last Pecha Berry in kindergarten, ending with Slowbro slapping Umbreon with a wet tail.

Back to present.

Umbreon: “I don’t work for freeloaders.”

Slowbro: “At least I don’t faint from tickles, you overgrown Roomba!”

Trevenant groans from the wheelbarrow, lifts a limp branch. “Pl… please don’t fight… I’ll pay…”

Umbreon raises an eyebrow. “Very well. Room 3. Mental Detox Chamber.”

-

Later, after Trevenant’s wheeled off, Slowbro stays behind and smugly leans on the counter.

Slowbro: “Y’know, even with all your books and flashlights, you still can’t tank a single Focus Blast.”

Umbreon (without looking up): “And yet you need a Shellder just to remember how to walk.”

The tension crackles.

Suddenly—BOOM.
Snorlax falls from the ceiling like a living meteor, bounces once, and pancakes Slowbro straight out of the building like a rubber ball.

Snorlax (grunting): “Hospital rules. No rival slap-fests.”

Umbreon: sips Oran juice and resumes paperwork “Next patient.”

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


Chapter: Amnesia vs Firebomber


Scene: Grimy alleyway behind the hospital district.

Slowbro, still steaming from being Snorlax-launched, grumbles to himself while holding his cracked shell, leaving a faint trail of slime and blood. He walks right into Armarouge, who's leaning against a dumpster tossing a fireball between his hands like a coin.

Armarouge (smirking): “You’re that meathead from the hospital, right? Heard you got booted by that Umbreon freak. Same guy who screwed over my boss.”

Slowbro (scratching his chin): “Huh... Umbreon... Yeah, I hate that guy…”

Armarouge (snickering): “Then maybe you should stop healing his friends and start burning his bridges.”

Slowbro just shrugs and waddles off. Armarouge narrows his eyes.

BOOM. The alley explodes behind Slowbro— flames and shrapnel flying— but the pink tank stumbles out of the smoke, scorched but alive, dripping blood and fury.

Slowbro (monotone): “That was rude.”

He lifts his arms, and his shell glows faintly purple—telekinesis hurls Armarouge against the wall. Trash cans scatter. The two square off.

Armarouge, with a grin, lobs a Flamethrower, but MISFIRES—

The flame arcs wide and slams into Mamoswine, who was walking across the street holding an umbrella for his wife, Alolan Ninetales.

Mamoswine (growling): “You WHAT?!”

He blocks the blast, tusks steaming, but ends up bruised. Ninetales whimpers, backing behind him.

Armarouge (realizing): “Uh… wasn’t aiming for you…”

Back to Slowbro, who's now on one knee—his telekinesis flickering, blood pouring from the shell crack. He lifts his hand weakly—

And collapses, flat on the pavement.

Just as the tension spikes—rainbow light descends from above.
Ho-Oh, as if on cue, floats down and taps Slowbro with divine grace.

Slowbro gasps awake.
Ho-Oh (calmly): “That’s once.”

Armarouge is gone. Fled during the resurrection glow.
Mamoswine checks on Ninetales. They walk away quietly.

Slowbro (blinking): “What the shell just happened…”


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


Chapter: Amnesia vs Sugarcoated dreams

Scene: Somewhere near the closed amusement park ruins, mid-day.

Slowbro, still limping from the earlier explosion and with a small bandage on his cracked shell, squints at a weird machine humming beside a broken gumball dispenser.
A large sticker reads: "TRY ME! Get Rich Quick in Dreams!"
The "i" in “Rayquasa” is dotted with a star. Clearly cursed.

Slowbro (blank stare): “…meh.”

He kicks it. Bad move.
A mini-Rayquasa emerges and rockets into his face like a mosquito.
Dream machine activated.

-

Inside Slowbro’s mind — 2 dream weeks compressed into 5 real minutes:

Slowbro, now buff, rich, and standing on a pile of cash, laughs while being fed berries by a harem of blushing Pokémon girls.
Espeon clings to his arm whispering, “Umbreon never paid attention like this…”

Gardevoir throws petals.
Tinkaton rants about how Ttar just “doesn’t understand softness.”
Tsareena... just kind of walks away halfway through.
Slowbro (dream): “Bruh.”

He turns on a crystal ball and loads Porkyman.net—somehow a real website in the dream.
He scrolls casually.

-

Reality — 5 minutes later:

Still dazed, Slowbro stumbles down the sidewalk, phone still out, drooling.
Without looking, he walks headfirst into Mimikyu, owner of the local daycare.

Mimikyu (deadpan): “...What the hell is this content?”

She yanks the phone, closes the browser with her ghostly tendrils, and frowns deeply.
Children peek from the windows.

Mimikyu (ominous): “Daycare is for babies, not whatever that site was.”

Slowbro (smiling doofily): “Heh. Bonk.”

Mimikyu sighs, takes his hand, and drags him inside.

-

Meanwhile, in the castle...

Darkrai, watching the footage through ghostly monitors, facepalms hard enough to knock a candle over.

Darkrai (grumbling): “WHAT is WRONG with these people...”

He turns to Armarouge, who’s stretching near the wall.

Darkrai: “100 squats. Now. You put that one near daycare. Do you WANT me on another watchlist?!”

Armarouge (groaning): “Bruh…”

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


Chapter: Daycare and Innocent Dreams


Scene: Mimikyu's Daycare, cozy, quiet.

Mimikyu hums eerily while preparing ghost pancakes for the kids.
Slowbro sits in the corner watching kids' cartoons with an unblinking smile.

Little Dreepy Boy, curious and restless, waddles outside to the play area.
There it is — the nightmare machine, glowing faintly behind the bushes, still sticky with "Slowbro drool."
Before Mimikyu notices—boop.

Dreepy gets absorbed.

-

Inside the dream (2 weeks in his head):

Dreepy is flying again, happy and warm in his mother Goodra's slimey embrace.
They’re picnicking under a rainbow, with soft harp music and sparkles.

Dreepy (tearing up): "Mommy... you’re back..."

Goodra (dream version): "I missed you, sweetheart..."

He laughs, spins, and floats in mid-air like a balloon on joy juice.

-

5 minutes pass in real life.

He wakes up with little tears in his eyes, sniffles, and calls out:

Dreepy: "Goodra-mommy…"

One of the Goomies nearby (his half-sister): "Mommy??"

All the baby Dragons look up. Even Slowbro snaps out of cartoon trance.

Mimikyu: “Uh-oh.”

-

Cut to: Dragapult, just outside the daycare in a shabby delivery outfit, holding a takeout bag labeled “Flareon’s Spicy Grill.”
He peers through the daycare window, watching his son cry for Goodra.

Dragapult (monologue): "...I should’ve fed that Rayquaza... I should’ve protected my family..."

Just as he sighs, Goodra happens to stroll by, arms full of groceries. She hears the cries of "Mommy!" and freezes.

She sees the daycare, sees Dragapult... and the moment hits like a Hyper Beam of emotion.

Groceries drop. Slime glistens. She walks forward.

-

Inside daycare, seconds later:

Door creaks open. Goodra walks in slowly.

Dreepy’s eyes widen.
Goomy gasps.
Dragapult drops his hat.

They hug like it’s the last episode of a soap opera. The room fills with soft Dragon energy sparkles.

Goodra (teary): “I only left to save enough to feed you…”

Dragapult (softly): “Then let’s feed them together…”

They kiss. Dreepy and Goomy cheer.

Slowbro (sniffling): “Happy slime...”

-

Meanwhile, far away in the shadows of his glitchy monitor room...

Darkrai watches this wholesome drama.

He hurls a chair at the wall.

Darkrai: "WHY?! I PUT THAT MACHINE IN A DUMPY CORNER!! THIS WAS SUPPOSED TO TRAUMATIZE HIM!"

Armarouge (doing push-ups, again): “You said not near a daycare this time…”

Darkrai: “THAT WAS A TECHNICALITY!!”


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

JOJO references INCOMING!!!


Chapter: Nightclub Brawls Pt.1


Scene: Inteleon's Club Pub Bar – Neon, smoky, jazzy ambiance.

Incineroar leans back on the couch, one paw on a drink, the other around Meowscarada, who's on stage doing a sultry Poké-dance routine to a slowed-down remix of "Porkyman Anthem."

Outside, Buzzwole patrols with pride, veins glistening under the streetlight, flexing with each step like he's modeling for an invisible camera.

Then — he spots it.

A suspicious machine with a shiny bottle of alcohol attached.

Buzzwole (reading sign aloud):
“Drink to see dreams of greatness.”

He shrugs.

Buzzwole: “Buzz needs dreamzzz... and buzz.”

He downs the alcohol in one chug, then punches the machine with a bellowing "YEAAAH!"
Zzzzap.
Mini Rayquaza absorbed him.

-

Buzzwole’s Nightmare (2 weeks in his head):

He becomes rich, worshipped, and surrounded by baddies — Tsareena, Lilligant, Lopunny, and even Meowscarada.
He flexes with Tyranitar’s charisma, married again to Pheromosa. Everyone calls him Buzz Daddy.

But then—

Divorce papers.
Backstabs.
Lawsuits.
Tsareena leaves him for real Ttar.
His muscles shrink.
Pheromosa laughs.
Everything burns.
“NOOOO!”

-

Back in real life — 5 minutes later.

Buzzwole wakes up, drunk on dreamlust, trembling with rage and delusion.

Buzzwole (snarling): “It’s MY club now!”

He smashes into the pub, uppercuts Incineroar, who slams into a beer keg and goes limp.

Inteleon (panicking): “HOLY– SOMEONE CALL–!”

-

Cue: Squeal of tires.

Machamp & Miraidon arrive in a screech, drifting to a halt.

Buzzwole roars, grabs Meowscarada, and ties her with neon rope from the club decor.
He licks his lips, posing in front of the tied dancer.

Machamp (cracking all four knuckles): “You messed with the wrong gym.”

Buzzwole (flexes): “WRYYYYYY!!”

-

Cue epic Jojo-style fight:

- Machamp: “ORA ORA ORA ORA!!”

- Buzzwole: “MUDA MUDA MUDA MUDA!!”

Fists blur. Beams crack walls. Bar gets wrecked.

Inteleon tries to sneak away, but Buzzwole punches through the bar counter, draining his life with Leech Life.
Inteleon screams and collapses — dead.

-

Miraidon: “Enough!!”

He launches in full speed, electric wheels blazing, and slams into Buzzwole's gut, oozing green blood onto the dancefloor.

Buzzwole stumbles, roaring in pain, but retaliates by punting Miraidon across the room.

But...

Machamp lands behind him and delivers a final barrage —
“ORAORAORAORAORAORAORA!!”

Buzzwole crashes through the stage and collapses unconscious.

-

Ho-Oh swoops down, shimmering in rainbow light.

He sees the scene — blood, broken lights, twitching bodies — and revives Inteleon with a glowing feather.

Inteleon (weakly): “…ow…”

-

Meowscarada (untied, shaken):
“Ho-Oh… that machine… it had alcohol… and it’s not the only one.”

Ho-Oh (nodding grimly):
“I will inform the Guardians. This is no longer an isolated prank.”

She pulls out her phone and tries to call Tyranitar…

Cut to: Ttar asleep on his lab couch, phone buzzing unanswered, snoring.

-

Scene fades to black.

Darkrai, watching it all unfold from the shadows, whispers:

“One... by one...”


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


Chapter: Nightclub Brawls Pt.2


Scene: Luxurious Golden Courtroom – "Justice Fortress" inside Tyranitar’s Manor

Gilded walls, marble floors, and a massive diamond gavel sit in front of the Honorary Judge:
Dressy Tinkaton, in her most fashionable suit-dress hybrid, swinging her gavel like she means business.

Buzzwole, shackled in chains, stands in the middle — defiant, bloodied but still flexing, surrounded by security with Machamp.

In the crowd:

- CEO Bodyguard Tyranitar, arms crossed, glaring.

- Meowscarada, seated beside Incineroar, arms bandaged.

- Dragonite, serving tea and holding evidence files.

- Pheromosa, sitting coldly across the courtroom in a velvet seat, legs crossed and eyes sharp.

- Inteleon, patched up, sunglasses on, flipping through documents smugly.

-

Dressy Tinkaton (slamming gavel):
“Court is now in session. Buzzwole, you stand accused of bar destruction, attempted kidnapping, first-degree ‘horny assault’, and the death — temporary — of bartender Inteleon.”

Buzzwole (scoffing):
“I did what I wanted. I don’t regret it. I’m Buzz. I don’t apologize.”

Meowscarada:
“You’re a freak. Go back to your sick daydreams.”

Buzzwole (grinning):
“You were in them too, sweetheart.”

Incineroar growls. Tyranitar punches his own hand.

Tyranitar (deep voice):
“Buzz, you’re a disgrace to all hired muscle. You’re not a bodyguard. You’re a body liability.”

Buzzwole:
“Then make me shut up!”

Tinkaton stands.
“Gladly.”

She swings her gavel — it turns into a warhammer. Buzzwole dodges.

Tyranitar smashes Buzzwole into the floor from the side.

Pheromosa (calmly walking up, heels clicking):
“I left you for a reason.”

She spin-kicks him in the face. Buzzwole rolls over, groaning.

-

Final Verdict:

- 2 years prison sentence, with full toilet cleaning duty across Tyranitar’s manor.

- Chains are laced with micro-explosives if he even tries to leave the perimeter.

- Also banned permanently from Meowscarada’s presence and any club or bar in the region.

- Forced to listen to Pheromosa’s breakup playlist on loop in his cell.

-

As Buzzwole is dragged out screaming:

Buzzwole:
“I’LL BE BACK!! I’LL BE– wait this isn’t even flushable– AAAAAAARGH!”

Meowscarada:
“Trash belongs in the bin.”

Inteleon lights a cig, sighing.
“Justice tastes like smoke and salt.”

Chapter: Poolside Paradise turned Devonian Disaster



Greninja and Delphox sit on the edge of the crystal-clear pool, feet in the water. Nearby, Flareon and Vaporeon are playfully splashing each other while sharing chilled Pecha smoothies. The mood? Romantic chaos.

Delphox (slipping):
“Whoops—!”
Splash.

Greninja (catching her bridal-style again):
“Third time this hour.”

Vaporeon (carrying Flareon out from another accidental cannonball):
“Don’t worry, mine’s just as flammable.”

The two couples laugh until Delphox narrows her eyes toward a strange machine beside the juice stand — glowing faintly, eerie hum pulsing.

Delphox:
“That's... one of his.”

Greninja (nods seriously):
“Darkrai.”

Delphox:
“Let's not poke it. Take notes, leave it to someone expendable.”

-

Meanwhile...

Gyarados, the giant lifeguard lounging lazily nearby, overhears them while sunbathing.

Gyarados (grumbling):
“Machine? Ugh. Lemme handle it like a man-fish.”

He stomps over and headbutts the machine.
Mini-Rayquaza absorbs him.

Five minutes later...
He bursts into the indoor meeting room, eyes glowing, roaring in ancient fish tongue, and floods the building, imagining it as a Devonian aquatic paradise with jawless fish citizens and trilobite floaties.

-

Delphox and Flareon start to choke from the rushing water, but—

- Greninja bridal-swims Delphox up the current.

- Vaporeon grabs Flareon, riding a hydro vortex upward.

They escape just as Gyarados snaps out of it mid-roar:

Gyarados (panicking):
“Oh Carp—WHAT HAPPENED?!”

Realizing what he did, Gyarados bows to Greninja.

Gyarados (groveling):
“I’ll pay—everything! Please don’t tell the Water Type Council... or the cops. Especially not the cops!”

-

Meanwhile nearby…

Goodra bridal-carries Dragapult while gliding along a skywalk path.

Goodra (smiling, sees Vaporeon bridal-carrying Flareon):
“Aww… that’s adorable.”

Dragapult (spots Flareon):
“Hey, fire-boy! You used to deliver my spicy rolls!”

Flareon:
“Still got your tip, old man!”

They laugh and head together toward Espeon’s Library, unaware that more dark machines are spreading behind the scenes.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


Chapter: Espeon’s Library – Cozy and peaceful... until it isn’t.


Espeon lounges behind the main desk with a cup of Roseli tea, scrolling through Porkyman fanfic of Umbreon— her husband— on the staff laptop. Just as she mutters, “Why does everyone ship him with Zoroark...”—

Dragapult silently phases through the wall.

Dragapult (casual):
“Hey.”

Espeon (SCREAMING):
“WAAAAAAH—!!”

She launches herself into the air—only to be caught bridal-style by Umbreon, who had just arrived with a stack of books.

Umbreon (dryly):
“Reading my fanfics again?”

Espeon (grumbling):
“They wrote you like some edgy beefcake— it's weirdly accurate.”

Dragapult (sweating ghost bullets):
“Uh. Sorry. Just came to say: there’s another of those nightmare machines. Gyarados went feral at the pool. Delphox barely made it.”

Espeon snaps into action, cracking her psychic fingers and slamming open her laptop.

Espeon:
“PsychicNet, EspHub, Twibird, I’m lighting all of them up— this machine nonsense ends now.”

-

In the background, Flareon (their son) and his girlfriend Vaporeon are organizing books and helping scan library IDs. They overhear the convo, and Vaporeon immediately starts taking photos of the warning notice. Flareon pulls up the library's comms and uploads it to school, local, and emergency groups.

Vaporeon (focused):
“This should go viral by lunch. #DarkraiMachine is trending.”

Flareon:
“Let’s get the word to our teachers too— maybe even the mayor.”

-

Goodra walks by with a grocery bag, overhearing it all.

Goodra:
“If we’re doing favors— Dragapult, sweetie, mind delivering lunch again? Spicy Kelp Dumplings, plus berry salad. Flareon, you’re fire, so make sure it’s hot!”

Flareon (salutes):
“Yes ma’am!”

Umbreon (dad mode):
“And if I catch one more sugar-drenched slowpoke bun, you’re grounded until next evolution.”

Espeon (giggling):
“You say that like it’s a threat, but last time you grounded him, he evolved with extra fluff.”

Flareon (embarrassed):
“Mommmm...”

-

As the team scatters to do their part, somewhere in the shadows, Darkrai stares at trending posts online...

Darkrai:
“They’re going viral over a terror device? No. No no no—this was supposed to be NIGHTMARE, not NOSTALGIA CORE.”

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Chapter: Tyranitar's Apathy

Scene: Tyranitar’s Luxury Office – CEO of WarioWare Inc.

Tyranitar lounges on his reinforced platinum chair, eating gold-leaf-topped snacks while scrolling through his massive triple monitor setup. On screen: #DarkraiMachine, now the top trending topic in the region.

Tyranitar (chuckling):
“Pfft. ‘Nightmare machines’? What’s next—Gengar doing taxes? Please. Probably just another prank for views.”

He kicks back and nearly tips his desk.

-

Tinkaton, standing nearby with a worried frown and her hammer resting against her shoulder, watches the newsfeed as well. Her pink eyes narrow.

Tinkaton:
“This... doesn’t feel fake, honey. Too many cases. The hospital, the pool, even that daycare... kids were crying about their ‘melty brains.’”

Tyranitar (shrugging):
“Bah. Probably some fairy soap drama. Unless it’s making me money, it ain’t real.”

-

Tinkaton, clearly done with her boss’s apathy, pulls out her phone and dials Detective Gardevoir.

Tinkaton (firmly):
“Gardevoir. It’s Tinka. I need you to investigate this nightmare machine trend. It’s turning real ugly. Bring Lucario.”

-

Meanwhile – Gardevoir & Lucario’s Apartment

Lucario is doing dishes, while Gardevoir floats upside-down on the couch with a psychic magnifying glass, browsing old case files.

Phone rings.
Gardevoir picks up, eyes instantly sharp.

Gardevoir:
“On it.”

Lucario (dryly):
“What now, another regional catastrophe?”

Gardevoir (floating upright):
“Potential psychic warfare, dream-based assault, and viral mass panic.”

Lucario:
“Yep. Regional catastrophe.”

They grab their coats.

-

Later That Day – City Sirens Blare

Screens across the city flash with “CODE NIGHTMARE – REPORT SUSPICIOUS ARCADE DEVICES” warnings. Helicopters buzz the skies. Police forces are on alert. Hospitals and libraries are locking down.

Everyone’s taking action.

Everyone... except Tyranitar.

Tyranitar (sipping expensive tea):
“Y’all are sheep. Bet next week it’s ‘Mimikyu turns people into plushies.’”

Suddenly, his office lights flicker.

He stops sipping.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUICIDE WARNING!!!


Chapter: Emotional Skyfall


Midnight – Behind the Castle Headquarters of Tyranitar’s Corporate Empire
Darkrai lurks in the shadows, whispering his curses to the wind. He slithers his next trap—another cursed arcade machine—right at the cargo bay doors near the tech department. This one flickers with a new message:
"DEBUG LIFE ITSELF. ENTER NOW."

It’s bait. For one specific soul.

-

Inside the building...

Dragonite, code debugger, IT specialist, and occasional emotional support Pokémon for half the employees, just finished another 14-hour shift patching PorkyNet security leaks and false order glitches.

Dragging his tired wings through the back hall, he sees it.

Dragonite:
“Huh... who left a dev console out here?”

He taps it.

FLASH.
His eyes widen. His breath halts. He’s sucked in.

-

[Inside the Nightmare Machine – 2 Weeks in Mind, 5 Minutes IRL]

In the dream, Dragonite is no longer a worker.
He’s a Pal.
A pet. A tool. A joke.
He’s caught, owned, ordered around to mass produce chaos, just like in the recent "Pals-But-Not-Pokemon" knockoff MMO.

He’s no longer fixing the code.
He is the code.
No purpose. Just scripted loops.
And then... everything glitches. His dream family vanishes. His trainer says, “You were replaceable anyway.”

Dragonite, broken:
“Am I... even a character anymore...?”

-

IRL – 5 Minutes Later

Dragonite's body spasms awake— screaming mid-air over the castle spires.
He rockets upward into the night sky, eyes wild and full of despair.

Dragonite (wailing):
“I’M A METAPHOR! A PAYWALL GAG!! AAAHHHH—”

-

Suicune, detecting the psychic tremor in the wind currents, alerts Ho-Oh, who immediately dives from the clouds.
He blazes upward in a streak of gold and red fire.

Within seconds, he intercepts Dragonite mid-fall from space, catching him before his wings lock up.

Ho-Oh (calm but firm):
“No one dies over lore confusion on my watch.”

He winged the stunned Dragonite, whose tears freeze in the upper air, and brings him gently down—

—not to a hospital,
—not to a lab,
—but to the grassy cliffside near the castle, where the city lights flicker below and starlight shines above.

-

There, waiting under the lamppost, is Suicune.
She kneels beside Dragonite.

Suicune (softly):
“You are not a parody. You are Dragonite.
A code fixer. A helper. A friend.
Let others be jokes. You keep the system alive.”

Dragonite sniffles. His heart slows.
He looks to the castle tower he once climbed daily for bug reports.
He nods.

Dragonite (quietly):
“I... want to go back to work.”

Ho-Oh:
“Good. But sleep first. No overtime tonight.”

-

Darkrai, watching from a rooftop... throws a nearby trash can into the void.

Darkrai (furious):
“CURSE YOU, EMOTIONAL RECOVERY!!”

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

GORE WARNING!!!


Chapter: Bitter Blade Pt.1


Same night, same city—on a rooftop beneath buzzing neon
Jolteon sits alone, soda in paw, kicking a soda can gently.
The skyline reflects off his fur—static-charged and twitching. He remembers what Vaporeon and Flareon told him earlier:

“If you see a weird machine, don’t touch it.”

But he sees it anyway.
Flickering. Tempting.
Cracked screen. Broken buttons.
And one glowing word:

"JOLT."

-

Before he even moves... a shadow darts across the alley.
Zoroark, battle-worn and bleeding, stumbles forward, panting hard.
She's been chasing someone.

Zoroark (growling):
“Ceruledge... where are you, you traitorous metal ghost...”

From the smoke— he appears.
Ceruledge, blazing blue swords ready.
He's faster. Colder. Stronger than the last time they met.

Jolteon stands. Sparks fly.
He doesn't hesitate.

Jolteon (gritting teeth):
“You're not laying another claw on her.”

The fight explodes.

Sparks, blades, illusions—
But Ceruledge is too wild, too skilled.

A slash to Zoroark’s gut.
A slice across Jolteon’s belly.
Both fall.

-

Jolteon, bleeding, barely breathing, fumbles for his phone.
He tries to speak.
His paw hits redial— Vaporeon.

Vaporeon (hearing static and crashing):
“...Jolteon?! Jolteon!?”

She hears screams. Metal. A thud.
The line goes dead.

-

Flareon, in her bedroom, drops her Pokebook.
Her fur bristles.

Flareon:
“No. Not him. Not tonight.”

She grabs her emergency flare and fires it out the window.
Seconds later, Ho-Oh descends from the sky like divine fire.
Suicune gallops across water, Vaporeon already on her back.

Together, they rush to the alley.

-

Scene: blood, broken machines, scorched pavement.

Ho-Oh lands, Flareon jumps off.
Vaporeon runs, breath caught in her throat.

They see the bodies.

Vaporeon (sobbing):
“Jolteon... please... not you...”

Ho-Oh kneels silently.
His wings glow.
His eyes tired, feathers duller than usual.

Ho-Oh:
“I’m... getting too old for this.”

With a long breath—
Fire and light envelop the fallen.

Both Jolteon and Zoroark are revived, coughing, aching.

-

Zoroark, newly healed but bitter, sees her wounds still echo in her mind.

Zoroark (spitting):
“That sword freak... he’s the one who sold us out. Who cut down Pikachu back then.”

Vaporeon (stern):
“No. He wasn’t working alone. You were allies once, remember?”

She steps forward.

Vaporeon (softly):
“He’s working for Darkrai now. Maybe not directly. Maybe he’s twisted, too.
But he’s not the boss behind this.”

Zoroark freezes.

Zoroark (growling low):
“...That nightmare freak. I should’ve slit his throat when I had the chance.”

Her claws light with illusionary flames. Her eyes burn with vengeance.

-

Above them, on a billboard far away...

Darkrai stares silently.
He does not laugh this time.

He did not want Zoroark revived.
But he saw something else that disturbed him more.

A rising alliance.


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

GORE WARNING!!!

Chapter: Bitter Blade Pt.2


Same cursed night, Ceruledge limps through the alleyways.
Blood trails from his cracked armor.
Jolteon and Zoroark nearly cost him everything.

He mumbles to himself, blade dragging across a wall, when—

A sudden shimmer.

Zacian steps out from behind a lamppost.
Her fur sleek, sword in maw, glowing with grace and wrath.

Zacian (coldly):
“Blood on your blade. You’re under suspicion, outlaw.”

Ceruledge hisses and throws a smoke bomb.
But she’s too fast—

Zacian slashes through the smoke.
Ceruledge tumbles out the other side...

...right into Aegislash.

The ghost blade, silent and terrifying, floats downward.
Aegislash isn’t here for talk.
Just judgment.

Aegislash (in distorted voice):
“You crossed a line.”

Ceruledge draws both blades, trembling.
He’s outmatched. Outflanked.

Zacian dashes left.
Aegislash strikes right.

Ceruledge’s feet are gashed.
He collapses, unable to stand.
The smoke fades.

-

Blaziken, who was on his way to buy protein shakes, sees the chaos.

He sprints forward.
One flaming punch—
Ceruledge gets slammed into the pavement, mask cracked.

Blaziken (to Zacian):
“Need a tag in?”

Zacian (sharpening her blade):
“No need. He’s done.”

Ceruledge (spitting blood):
“Fine! FINE! It was the nightmares! I was promised strength... power! I didn’t ask for this!”

-

Scene change: Tinkaton’s Luxurious Trial Hall
The throne room is marble and madness.

Ceruledge kneels in chains, feet bandaged, eyes twitching.

Tinkaton, wearing a rose-tinted business dress and holding her oversized gavel, sneers.

Tinkaton:
“Let’s just say I’m not... fond of murderers who also suck at hiding it.”

Tyranitar, arms crossed, standing behind her as CEO security, rolls his eyes.

Tinkaton (bonks him):
“Two years. No bail.”

-

Gardevoir appears in a shimmer of psychic light.
Elegant. Cold.

Lucario at her side, arms folded.

Gardevoir (smiling faintly):
“Enjoy your stay. The black hole is... cozy.”

A psychic rift opens behind her.
It hums with quantum echoes and screams of failed NFTs.

Ceruledge is dragged into it, howling.

-

Tinkaton turns to her court.
“Let this be a warning. No edge-lords allowed in my city. Unless they’re fashionable.”

Applause.

Outside, Zacian, Aegislash, and Blaziken shake hands silently.
Ceruledge may be gone...

...but Darkrai is still watching.

And fuming.


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

VORE WARNING!!!


Chapter: Fried Food Fight Pt.1


Armarouge sat silently atop a neon billboard, staring down at the streets below.
He’d watched the Ceruledge takedown from the shadows.

“This city… they fight for each other,” he mutters.
“Not like back home…”
His fists tighten. But he remains still.
For now.

-

Next night: The skies hum with growing tension.
Security gets an upgrade.

Enter: Metagross.
Cold. Calculating. Four-legged justice.
Now part of the city’s nightwatch.

-

Elsewhere, by a rundown park...

Cramorant waddles forward, eyes glossed, having just slurped open a forgotten machine.
A bottle of spicy sauce in one wing.
His mind? Gone.

He’s now in a dream.
Voreland. A twisted, lawless buffet where hunter and prey cycle endlessly.

Two weeks of chaos in his mind.
Five minutes outside.

When he snaps back—
He’s rampaging. Consumed by gluttony.

-

A Pachirisu screams.
He gets swallowed whole.

Another.
Gone.

-

Then—

Pikachu walks with his longtime girlfriend, Alolan Raichu, sipping spicy soda under the stars.
Romantic. Peaceful.

Until Cramorant spots them.

Cramorant (gurgling):
“Food… delicious… must... complete the course…”

He activates his makeshift electric-proof armor—a cobbled mess of rubber gloves and fridge parts.
And lunges.

Pikachu (shouting):
“Rai, get back—!”

Too late.

Raichu is swallowed whole.
The shock leaves Pikachu in stunned horror.

-

Boom.

Metal slams the ground.

Metagross arrives.
Eyes burning blue.
Engines humming with psychic precision.

Metagross (robotic monotone):
“Unauthorized digestion detected. Prepare for containment.”

Cramorant panics.
But can’t react in time—

One massive punch.

Cramorant’s beak cracks open.
Raichu flies out, spiraling— lands perfectly onto a park bench, dazed but alive.

Pikachu rushes in and hugs her.
Eyes wet. But she's okay.

-

Metagross uses gentle psychic waves, pulling the madness from Cramorant’s mind.

He blinks.

Looks at his feathers.
At the destruction.
The screaming Pichu hiding in the trash can.

Cramorant (softly):
“What… have I done?”

Pikachu (stern but soft):
“You were cursed. But don’t come near us again.”

He hands Cramorant a single Oran berry.

Pikachu:
“Go. Heal. And stay gone.”

Cramorant takes it...
...bows silently…
...and flees into the night, tears behind him.

-

Metagross scans the broken machine part nearby.
Darkrai’s signature confirmed.

The war continues.

But tonight, the couple was saved.

And Armarouge still watches.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

GORE AND SHIT WARNING!!!

Chapter: Fried Food Fight Pt.2


Same night.

Cramorant, still mentally wrecked and shame-drenched, waddles sadly near Charizard’s fancy flame-grilled BBQ restaurant.
Then—
His stomach grumbles.
He squats.

A violent poop explosion erupts against the alley wall like a cursed geyser.

Charizard (hearing it):
“ARE YOU SERIOUS RIGHT NOW?!”

He storms out mid-grill, sees the crime scene, and roars, fire puffing out his nostrils.

Charizard:
“GET OUTTA HERE, FEATHERED NIGHTMARE!!”

Cramorant panics and flaps away.

-

From a rooftop, Armarouge watches.

He snorts.
“Useless bird.”

He lobs a firebomb.

SPLAT.
Blood and poop mix splashes all over Cramorant’s face.

Cramorant (deadpan):
“…I just wanted to be normal again…”

-

But that was too far.

Venusaur, Blastoise, and Charizard step in.

They surround Armarouge in a triangle formation.

Charizard cracks his knuckles.
Blastoise loads his cannons.
Venusaur slams his vines down.

Armarouge activates Fire Spin.
Inferno erupts.

Venusaur gets scorched.

He groans in pain.

Charizard (gritting teeth):
“I love fire… but not when you hurt my crew.”

He jumps in, wings flared, and slams Armarouge with a Seismic Toss straight into the pavement.

Blastoise puts out the flames, then hoses Armarouge with industrial soap foam.

Armarouge chokes on bubbles.
He’s done.

-

Blaziken arrives, takes Armarouge in cuffs.

Ho-Oh swoops in shortly after, seeing Cramorant twitching in filth and ashes nearby.

Ho-Oh (sighs):
“You again… I need more food if this keeps up.”

Charizard hands him a full tray of grilled ribs and Sitrus sauce.
“On the house.”

Ho-Oh nods, eats mid-flight, and revives Cramorant again.

Cramorant whimpers.
But lives.

-

Later, in the Grand Trial Hall...

Tinkaton stands ready.
Armarouge kneels, still drenched in foam.

BONK.

The hammer lands.

Sentence: Black hole prison.
Same as Ceruledge.

Separate rooms. No bombs allowed.

-

The fire twins are finally both out of the streets.
But the war?
Far from over.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

GORE WARNING!!!


Chapter: Darkness Event Horizon Pt.1


Darkrai watched from the shadows, whispering coldly to himself:

| “The twins… were just useless rats. As expected.”

-

Next night.

The city lay still—but the alleys were twitching.

Greninja was walking with his close bro circle:
Cinderace (cocky as ever),
Decidueye (stoic and sharp),
and his mystical girlfriend Delphox by his side.

They strolled through the outer districts, catching up, joking around, but Delphox suddenly froze. Her staff trembled faintly.

Delphox:
| “The alleys… feel wrong. Something terrible is near.”

Cinderace:
| “Chill, fox. What’s the worst that could happen?”

Decidueye:
| “She’s always seeing shadows. Let's go see if it bites.”

Delphox:
| “Don’t. I saw echoes. Rayquaza's legacy. He's returning.”

But they didn’t listen.

Cinderace and Decidueye veered off into a shadowed alley, curious and skeptical.

Greninja reached out— too late.

-

Inside, the fog thickened.

Echoes whispered “Fortune. Fame. Gal pals. MLM freedom.”

They saw visions of money. Success. Tsareena on each arm.

Then—

Darkrai rose.

| “Ah... finally. New toys.”

Beside him, Rayquaza 4.0 ripped through the ground like corrupted code come alive.

He reached for them—
Cinderace tried a Pyro Ball. Dodged.

Decidueye raised his bow.

| “We meet again, freak.”

The Spirit Shackle barely missed.
Rayquaza 4.0 reflected it, cleaving pavement behind.

Darkrai smirked.

| “Let’s turn fantasy into torment.”

Both were dragged into nightmare loops—

- Tsareena clones kissing them.

- Constant MLM success.

- Then getting hunted each day.

Two weeks in mind. Five minutes in reality.

-

Then blood splattered down the alley walls.

Decidueye and Cinderace were dead.

Greninja and Delphox arrived moments too late.

Darkrai reached for Delphox.

But Greninja pulled out a Fairy Capsule, activating it at point-blank range.

Searing light burst into Darkrai’s face.

He howled, temporarily blinded for two days, and fled into the night.

Delphox was dropped mid-air—
Greninja leapt, caught her bridal-style, and rolled into safety.

-

They both knelt by their fallen friends, grief-stricken.

Delphox held Decidueye’s broken feather.

Greninja placed a hand on Cinderace’s scorched mask.

No words.
Just silence.


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


Chapter: Darkness Event Horizon Pt.2


That night, the city dimmed a little more. The fog didn’t clear—it thickened.

Darkrai, lurking in a chasm deeper than before, whispered to himself as he reassembled the machine:

| “Ho-Oh… always meddling. Let’s make sure these ones are unrevivable… or close to it.”

And so he did.

He altered their deaths—not to block revival, but to cost dearly:

- Massive caloric drain.

- Revive timers with compounding cooldowns.

- Rare protein powders required.

- And most importantly:
| Darkrai himself must be banished from the local astral zone— or Ho-Oh’s flames won’t reach.

-

Delphox knew. Her eyes had seen the script of fate unfold before.
She was already trembling when she and Greninja landed at Glaceon’s Freezer Hall on the cold north end of the city.

Glaceon gasped as the bodies were carefully passed over to her.
She immediately sealed them in a cryogenic stasis chamber.

Delphox (clutching Decidueye’s feather):
“You have four months. Keep them safe… or they’ll fade completely.”

Leafeon, just coming in from the garden shift, overheard— and dropped his tools in horror.
Vaporeon, just checking her messages, collapsed onto the wall, speechless.

The family was shaken.

-

Greninja stood guard that night.
Outside. Motionless.
His tears mixed with the rain, falling in silence.

And above all of them…

Darkrai had crossed the line.
He had officially passed the Moral Event Horizon.
This wasn’t mischief. It wasn’t chaos.

It was evil.

And he knew it.

| “Let’s see how much that Phoenix will burn to bring them back.”

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


Chapter: Nightmare Climax Pt.1


The next day, with the city still shaken, Delphox stood atop the frozen balcony of Glaceon’s hall, deep in thought.
She held Decidueye’s final arrow, cracked from the last battle, and whispered:

| “If we can’t reach Darkrai by force… we’ll have to make him come to us.”

She knew one thing about Darkrai: he despised Tyranitar.
Not just his ego, but his refusal to fall for manipulation.
And if anyone could irritate a shadow god into appearing, it was Ttar’s indifference.

Delphox paced. Her plan began to take shape.

-

| “We’ll pit apathy against cruelty,” she told Vaporeon and Greninja.
| “If I can get Darkrai to attack something Tyranitar values— his company, his rep, his money— he will retaliate.”

Vaporeon raised a concern.

| “Tyranitar’s tough, but he’s not clean. He could side with either one if pushed.”

Delphox smirked.

| “That’s why we stack the deck. We bring Fairy-types. Old blood, sacred ones. Beacons of purity.”

Vaporeon’s eyes lit up, and she turned immediately to her old mentor:

-

Sylveon.

Calm. Graceful. A retired diplomat and occasional seductress of peace.
When she heard what happened—her face dropped.

She stood, took a deep breath, and said:

| “I’ll fight. Not for the dead—but for the living.”

And she didn’t come alone.

She called upon her battle-sister— Galarian Rapidash, the fierce psychic unicorn.
And she sent a dream call to Zacian, the indie game guardian, who had already crossed blades with evil not long ago.

-

Zacian answered.

| “I heard about the two fallen… my blade’s been waiting. Let’s make the nightmare bleed.”

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


Chapter: Nightmare Climax Pt.2


Sylveon asked a delicate question— who did Darkrai personally despise, aside from Tyranitar?

The answer was Umbreon.

But before anyone could suggest a trap, his wife Espeon volunteered. Calm, graceful, and burning with a quiet fire, she offered herself as psychic prey to bait the shadow. Her bravery left no room for debate.

Their son, still young but no less brave, was told to stay home— guard the den. His girlfriend, Vaporeon, who had witnessed the horrific deaths of Cinderace and Decidueye, chose to remain by his side as his protector, healer, and cuddle-buddy.

“Good luck,” Umbreon whispered, nuzzling Espeon one last time, before vanishing into the setup.

-

One day after Darkrai’s blindness faded, whispers began to crawl along the walls of his ruined lair. Delphox’s echo—subtle, calculated—taunted him with Tyranitar’s name. Again. And again. It clawed at his ego.

“Coward,” the voice teased.

The fury inside him boiled over. If he couldn’t kill the seer, he’d end the brute she depended on.

-

He appeared at Tyranitar’s manor under a moonless sky. Before the shattered gate stood Espeon, radiant in a regal princess dress, moonlight catching every shimmer in her fur. She didn’t move. She didn’t run.

Darkrai’s twisted desire flared. This would be his trophy.

He lunged.

But in a flash of shadow and speed, Umbreon swept Espeon into his arms— bridal-style— and vanished into the shadows just as the doors slammed shut behind Darkrai. Too fast. He’d been baited. Worse, the Rayquaza 4.0 box he carried was locked inside with him.

And so was he.

Tinkaton’s fairy barrier, weaved through the manor halls, pulsed alive— unknown to Tyranitar himself.

Darkrai tried to flee. He couldn’t. Every hallway curved wrong. Every step felt like thorns. Then—

A sudden Hyper Voice from Sylveon erupted through the halls, paralyzing him in screaming agony. He stumbled right into position.

From the far corridor, Galarian Rapidash burst forward, Tinkaton riding her back like a knight of vengeance. With a crash, they slammed a secondary door shut, sealing the trap.

Inside the room stood Zacian, blade drawn.

A duel began— fairy steel versus abyssal shadows.

Darkrai fought desperately, not daring to summon Rayquaza yet. The fairy energy around him was suffocating— Ray would be just as vulnerable.

-

Meanwhile, Tyranitar stirred in his room, annoyed by the high-pitched noise echoing through his walls. He stepped out—only to be met by Rapidash, now alone, taunting him like an old rival.

“Wakey wakey, grumpzilla!”

He growled and chased her. She lured him— right into the trap room.

Inside, Zacian pivoted and launched herself backward— straight through a barrier- lined window, an intentional move that left the enemy exposed.

Tyranitar skidded into the room— and froze.

-

Darkrai.

His old comrade.

His greatest mistake.

His invader.

-

Tyranitar roared and charged. Darkrai, weakened, barely had the strength to summon Rayquaza 4.0 from the cursed box. But he did.

The beast emerged, pixelated and unnatural, MLM slogans screaming from its glitched jaws.

| “JOIN NOW FOR DREAM DIVIDENDS!”

Tyranitar didn’t care.

He grabbed Darkrai and slammed him— again and again— into the writhing Rayquaza 4.0. The impact sent waves of distortion through the air.

Rayquaza coughed— then vomited a glitched mass shaped like MissingNo, twitching and corrupted.

Still, it pitched. “LIMITED TIME!”

Tyranitar roared louder, powered by fury and fairy resonance. One final slam—

BOOOOM.

A blinding light. The manor shook. Debris and distortion filled the air. When it cleared—

Rayquaza 4.0 was gone.

Darkrai, disintegrated into mist. (dead for real)

Only Tyranitar stood, bruised, scorched, but alive.

-

Umbreon ran in first. Then Espeon. Then the rest— Tinkaton, Sylveon, Galarian Rapidash, Zacian.

They stared at the crater.

They stared at him.

Then, they cheered.

Tyranitar looked around, dazed. “Did I win or something?”

Umbreon chuckled, beginning to heal his wounds.

Espeon smiled and patted his thick shoulder. “You more than won.”

Tyranitar blinked. “...Are we friends now?”

Sylveon giggled. “You didn’t ruin it. That’s friendship enough.”

Galarian Rapidash reared back, wind swirling through her mane, and shouted across the field with pride:

“FRIENDSHIP IS MAGIC!!”

Chapter: Nightmare Climax Pt.3


But sadly, when they reached the corpses, it was already too late.

Glaceon’s sacred revival fridge— meant to preserve Cinderace and Decidueye for a second chance— had been shattered beyond repair. The shockwave from Ray 4.0’s final explosion had torn through it like paper. But worse still… this was no accident.

Darkrai had planned this. His spite extended beyond death.

In the event of his defeat, he had laid a curse— one final failsafe to ensure no resurrection, no redemption. The bodies of Cinderace and Decidueye had already begun to rot, consumed by a creeping shadow, until nothing was left but darkness itself… then mist… then silence.

Everyone from the manor gathered. Even Ho-Oh and Suicune arrived through the fading light, too late to stop the decay.

Ho-Oh, radiant in gold and fire, landed with a thunderous cry. His wings glowed, his halo burned with divine urgency. He tried everything. Sacred flames, life pulses, revival dances— he poured out his essence in one last desperate act.

-

But nothing happened.

-

There was no soul to bring back. Only emptiness.

He lowered his wings, eyes dimmed with grief.

Greninja, standing by the ruins, was frozen. Tears welled up until they broke free. He let them fall. He made no sound— he just mourned. For the friends he couldn’t save. For the dreams now burned to ash.

Leafeon fell beside him, burying his face in his leafy paws. His sobs shook his whole frame. The sorrow was too much.

Elsewhere in the manor, Vaporeon had locked herself away, unable to face the sight. Her tears flooded the room, rising to her chest. She held Flareon in her arms, cradling him bridal style as he clung to her, trying not to drown. She held him tighter, needing the warmth of someone she loved to keep from breaking.

Tyranitar stood alone, fists clenched at his sides. “…I should’ve cared more,” he whispered, voice cracking. “I should’ve…”

Espeon collapsed beside the fading spot where her son’s future teammates had vanished. She cried silently, her jewel dimmed with sorrow. Umbreon knelt beside her, gently pulling her into his embrace, shielding her from the world, even if he couldn’t shield her from the pain.

Sylveon stood with Galarian Rapidash. Both bowed their heads in solemn silence, mourning with grace.

Zacian, proud and powerful, slowly lowered her sword until it touched the earth, and kept it there, unmoving, like a grave marker.

Delphox— clever, fiery, always in control— was sobbing, her shoulders shaking under her cloak. Greninja, without words, stepped beside her and offered his hand. She took it, her claws trembling.

All of them stood in the shadow of what had been lost. Not just victory, but friends, family, futures.

The fairy barrier still flickered quietly in the distance, meaningless now— protection for a battle that had already taken its toll.

And high above, Ho-Oh gazed into the sky, his light dim but still burning… for the ones gone too soon.

For Cinderace.

For Decidueye.

For what could have been.

Author's Notes:

The "2 weeks of glory in a 5-minute trap" echoes the toxic illusion MLMs often spin: grand promises, perfect futures, and freedom—until the crash hits. Just like Darkrai clutching Ray 4.0, it's all smoke and mirrors. And when it breaks? People either crumble, or lash out to avoid admitting they were duped.


Mr. Mime in the earlier saga was a satire of corporate clownery and overhyped flash—more like a walking meme. His downfall was laughable, reflecting how gacha can be exploitative but still wrapped in absurdity and detachment. People lose, but they laugh, reroll, or uninstall.

Darkrai, though— he embodies something far worse. MLM scams don’t just drain wallets; they warp minds, ruin relationships, and prey on vulnerability. His descent from butt-monkey to full-blown antagonist isn't just for drama— it's the natural result of unchecked bitterness and ego trapped too long in delusion.

Chapter: Unable to Sing to Revive


Three days later…

The mist had barely settled. The world was still bruised, quietly mourning. Then came a gentle ripple across the water— Lapras returning from distant shores.

Riding its back: Wigglytuff, her tour over, her voice having echoed across regions in concerts of joy and healing. But joy had no place here right now.

Delphox awaited her at the shore. Their eyes met. Delphox didn’t have to say much.

Wigglytuff's cheerful face fell as Delphox briefly explained… what she could.

No full details were shared, but the truth weighed heavy.

Wigglytuff, usually full of bounce and jokes, fell silent for a beat, then said flatly:

| “Serves him right.”

Then a pause, softer now, her ears drooping slightly.

| “But… I’m sorry. I wish I was here. For them.”

She looked out toward the horizon. Her voice may have brought joy to distant crowds, but two dear souls would never hear her sing again.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


Chapter: Laughters in the Wrong Time


Elsewhere in the manor grounds, two voices echoed with laughter— Gengar and Sableye, still caught up in their usual chaotic energy, mocking even now.

“He really went boom with his little scam box!” Gengar wheezed.
“And those two— Cinderace and Decidueye? Hah! What a dumb way to go!” Sableye cackled.

They didn’t notice Galarian Rapidash trotting up behind them, her eyes glowing with fury. Without a word, she bucked both ghosts into a trash can with a loud CLANG!

She stood tall over the crumpled heap of mischief. “You two think death is a joke? That sacrifice means nothing?” she snapped, her mane flaring like wildfire.

Before they could respond, another voice joined in— choked with grief.

Tsareena, having heard everything, stepped forward. Her usual elegance now dulled by sadness. “Cinderace… Decidueye… they were my childhood friends.”

Tears welled in her eyes as she walked straight up to the trash can and gave it a devastated roundhouse kick, sending it— and the ghosts inside—flying a few feet.

Gengar and Sableye, now dazed and quiet, finally looked around at the mourning faces, the burned battlefield, the missing presence of two heroes.

They frowned. They looked down.

“…Sorry,” Gengar murmured.
“We didn’t get it… we do now,” Sableye added softly.

Even jokers learn, sometimes. Especially when grief speaks louder than laughter.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


Chapter: Harem and Luxury went Silent


That same day, in the quiet aftermath of the chaos, Tinkaton lay beside Tyranitar, the two of them finally finding a rare moment of stillness. No battle cries. No screams. Just the soft hum of a fan in the manor’s guest room and the weight of truth hanging heavy between them.

They talked— raw, unscripted.

Tinkaton admitted it first, voice low and eyes hollow.
| “Maybe I shouldn’t have put him to sleep for 200 years... I thought it would change him. Give him time to reflect.”

Tyranitar, arms behind his head, sighed.
| “And I used him as a pawn. Just because I was hurting. After Ray and the scam... I let anger make choices for me.”

They both stared at the ceiling in silence for a while, the names of Cinderace and Decidueye echoing in their minds like ghosts of laughter and flame.

But eventually, one of them smiled first. A tired, faint smile.

They couldn’t change the past. They couldn’t bring them back. But they could make sure the world didn’t forget them. They cheered each other up, not with fake positivity, but with a shared resolve to be better.

Elsewhere, the rest of the girls— Comfey, Liligant, Salazzle, and even Pheromosa —remained blissfully unaware. They were still off on their well-earned vacation, far from the climax that had just shaken the manor. They’d missed it all.

And maybe, for now, that was okay.

Chapter: Words of Wisdom about Death


Three days after the battle, the roar of jet engines echoed through the skies above Poketopia. Urshifu’s personal jet, sleek and obsidian with twin insignias of the Single and Rapid Strike styles, descended gracefully on the manor's landing strip.

Out stepped Urshifu, Garchomp, and Zeraora— fresh from their international meditation pitch overseas. Calm energy surrounded Urshifu, his presence grounded, while Garchomp stretched his wings with a grunt and Zeraora instantly scanned for trouble, sparks flickering in habit.

At the gate stood Ho-Oh, solemn and still, a quiet flame burning behind his eyes. No words were spoken at first.

But Urshifu knew.

He bowed his head slightly.
| “Two lives... lost.”

Ho-Oh nodded slowly, gaze heavy.

Urshifu closed his eyes and murmured softly,
| “Even the strongest strikes cannot undo fate. Life is fragile, and even the mightiest of us cannot escape its limits. Some passings... are permanent, no matter how fierce our devotion.”

Garchomp let out a low growl, fists clenched—not from anger, but quiet respect.

Zeraora, arms folded, tail twitching, didn’t say a word aloud. But in his mind, he grumbled,
| “This is why people don't trust Mythical Pokémon anymore... Darkrai really messed it up for all of us.”

Still, he didn’t voice it. Not now. Not in front of Ho-Oh’s mournful eyes.

They entered the manor in silence, now joining the world that had changed during their absence.

Chapter: Warm Eevee Reunion at Hospital


Inside Umbreon’s private hospital, the air was quiet, save for the faint hum of medical equipment and the rustle of wind outside. Jolteon, still wrapped in bandages from the brutal encounter with Ceruledge, lay resting on a cushioned bed. He had been feeling off—nausea, pulses of pain, and a strange lingering discomfort that no potion could quite reach.

Blissey and Clefable soon arrived, both dressed in soft nurse attire. They brought a tray of warm berry soup and golden puffs made with Moomoo milk.

"You're holding strong, Jolteon," Blissey said gently, her voice like a lullaby.

"We’re rooting for you," added Clefable with a wink, placing the food by his side.

"Thanks, both of you..." Jolteon muttered, managing a smile despite the pain. "You two are the nicest nurses around."

The two (fairy) nurses exchanged a sweet glance and left the room with a warm wave, closing the door softly behind them.

-

Hours later, as the school bell rang across the city, Umbreon arrived, gently pushing open the door with his shadow paw. He was joined by his graceful wife Espeon, their spirited son Flareon, and Vaporeon, Flareon's girlfriend, always with a caring gaze in her eyes.

Behind them came Leafeon and Glaceon— Vaporeon's parents. Leafeon held a satchel of hand-picked fruits, while Glaceon looked reserved, as if haunted by recent events.

Last to enter was Sylveon, their pink-ribboned teacher, proud and soft-spoken, now openly living as a transwoman, walking in with her usual calm and warm demeanor.

Jolteon brightened up at the sight of his extended family.

"Uncle Umbreon! Auntie Espeon! Teacher Sylveon! You guys are amazing… risking your lives to save the city. Everyone’s calling you heroes," he said, eyes wide with admiration.

He then paused, lowering his voice. "I’m sorry about Decidueye and Cinderace… they didn’t deserve that."

Glaceon winced, arms tightening around herself. “I should’ve built a stronger fridge… I failed…”

But Vaporeon leaned in and hugged her gently. “Mom… you did your best. You always do. We all know that.”

Flareon walked up with a grin, holding a little food box. “Made some fried fruits! Vapor's Dad grew ‘em, I cooked ‘em!”

Jolteon chuckled. “Smells way better than hospital food.”

Sylveon floated over and placed a folder by his bedside. “Here are the class slides. You’re marked for sick leave, of course—but I’m not letting you fall behind, star pupil.”

-

Umbreon stepped forward and gently placed a glowing paw over Jolteon's bandaged side. “No charge, kid. I’ll heal you up proper, and have you back in class in no time.”

Jolteon groaned, hiding under the blanket. “Ugh… school again already?”

Everyone laughed. The air lightened.

Yet as they all shared that warmth, Glaceon quietly turned to the window, her icy eyes scanning the clouds above. For just a moment, she imagined Decidueye and Cinderace— free, flying side by side in the sky, beyond pain, beyond fear.

She didn’t speak. But a single tear glistened down her cheek, melting quietly on the floor.


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


Chapter: Lost Sworn Brothers


Elsewhere, as the sun began to set, casting long golden shadows across the quiet fields…

Greninja stood silently atop a low hill, his eyes fixed on the sky. The wind rustled his scarf, but he didn’t move. He was lost in thought—no, in memory.

He could still see them. Cinderace, all fire and jokes. Decidueye, quiet but never absent. His comrades. His friends. His brothers. Now… just echoes in the mist.

As he stood there, he heard footsteps— quick, desperate.

Turning slightly, he saw a familiar figure approaching. Lopunny. Not just any Lopunny— the same one Tyranitar once wooed during the chaos after Rayquaza’s first fall. But this time, there was no flirtation in her step.

“Where is he?” she asked, voice shaking. “Where’s Cinderace?”

Greninja didn’t answer. He lowered his gaze.

“Where is my boyfriend?!” she shouted now, chest heaving, voice cracking with panic and denial. “Say something! Answer me!!”

Her fist lit up—pure instinct, pain and rage blurring into a kick aimed for Greninja’s chest.

Before it could connect, she was frozen in place mid-air, glowing in a soft purple hue.

Delphox had appeared silently, her wand raised. “Enough,” she said, her voice neither cold nor harsh—but heavy with sorrow. “Please… stop.”

Lopunny’s form trembled, but she couldn’t break the psychic hold.

“I’m sorry,” Delphox said softly, stepping closer. “We all are. Cinderace and Decidueye… they didn’t deserve this. But they also ignored every warning I gave them.”

Her voice broke ever so slightly. “I told them not to go. I told them not to meddle with Ray. I told them what would happen…”

“…Curiosity killed the Torch and the Arrow,” she whispered.

Greninja stepped forward, still stoic, but his tone low and remorseful. “I’m sorry too. I shouldn’t have let them go ahead. I… stepped just an inch too far behind.”

Lopunny finally crumbled— Delphox released her from the psychic grip, and she collapsed into the fire witch’s arms, sobbing. Deep, primal cries of loss.

Delphox held her gently, stroking her ears, whispering quiet apologies only the wind could hear.

The sun dipped below the hills, casting everything in dusky gold, as if nature itself was paying tribute.

Greninja stood beside them, unmoving, his gaze still on the fading light— where two brothers once stood beside him.
