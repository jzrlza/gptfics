Darkrai is the main antagonist in this saga.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


Prolouge: 200 years of darkness alone

Just after Darkrai got whack-a-moled by Tinkaton and before Gengar’s redemption…

Darkrai had been asleep for 200 years—but only in a dream, locked inside his own mental prison.
By year 69 of the dream sentence, he began plotting revenge against all Pokémon. His thoughts formed a twisted vision... a company logo:
"TIMI TIMMY Co."

Even in his vengeful haze, Darkrai cringed at the absurdity of the name.
Still, something about it pulled him forward. Using mental energy, he projected himself—far from the city—marking a site for the construction of a Dark Castle Lair, the predicted respawn point of the next gacha-machine.

By year 200, he awakened in the real world. Months passed as he quietly built the castle and conducted obscure research.
And then... it happened.
After Mime’s defeat, and Rayquaza’s third death, the gacha machine respawned—exactly as he foresaw.

But Darkrai wasn’t ready yet.
He spent more months preparing, studying the mechanics, digging through corrupted AI scripts and glitchy summon lore.

Now—after the peace of the beach day fades—Darkrai finally completes the final key: control.
Rayquaza, the scammy dragon, is released again for the fourth time.



-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Prolouge: 4th time's the charm

Rayquaza 4.0 – the MLM Pitcher Supreme

The fourth resurrection of Rayquaza, born from Darkrai’s post-dream recalibration, is no longer the fragile flashy dragon of old.
Rayquaza 4.0 still peddles lootboxes and probability-rigged banners with the fervor of a cult leader at a tech expo—but now, he’s structurally altered.

This version is:

- More resilient to Tyranitar’s one-shot finisher, having been remade with anti-Dark Pulse plating and “plot armor firmware.”

- Built with passive income logic loops, able to auto-sell banners while speaking.

- Still flashy, still loud, but now harder to meme out of existence.

Darkrai stands in the shadows, watching his MLM beast emerge, whispering,

| “This time, the scam is eternal.”

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Chapter: Darkness awakens Pt.1


Rain falls like whispers of dread.
Outskirts of the city—Bounty Hunter Greninja, cloaked in soaked shadows, tightens the scarf around his mouth. His quiet stroll halts as he sees it:
A dark castle, jagged and unnatural, oozing with black-purple energy.

From inside:
A cringeworthy pitch echoes,

| “LIMITED-TIME RAID PACK! DOUBLE THE DROP RATES—TRIPLE THE REGRET!”
| followed by Darkrai’s chilling laugh, warped by years of isolation and ego.

Greninja narrows his eyes. “He’s back…”

Without hesitation, he disappears into a water log mist. He must warn the city—and more importantly, Fortune Teller Delphox, his trusted partner and love.

She saw this coming. She always does.


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Chapter: Darkness awakens Pt.2


Inside Delphox’s warm hutch, candles flicker beside tarot cards and herbal incense.
Tsareena sits across from Delphox, her legs crossed like roots in meditation.

| “If you plant the mangosteen seed with care,” Delphox says gently, “especially during this rainy moon, your harvest will double. Twice the yield. | Twice the coin.”

Tsareena smiles, intrigued—until the door swings open with a sudden burst of wind.

Greninja steps in, dripping with rain, eyes sharp. “He’s back. The dark dreamer.”

Tsareena blinks. “Who?”

Delphox, with no hesitation:

| “Darkrai. He’s building again. And this time… the machine speaks.”

Greninja nods. “The scam-pitch castle’s no illusion. He’s baiting the city.”

Delphox closes her eyes. “There is only one Pokémon who can finish him. Tyranitar’s rocky hands… the prophecy’s final card. But he won’t believe it.”

Tsareena, now uneasy, looks out into the storm. “Then we’re doomed?”

Delphox stands and places a hand on her shoulder. “Not if you stay dry, and keep planting. Destiny favors patience.”

Tsareena, still confused, quietly exits into the rain—mangosteen seed in hand, unsure whether she’s walking away from nonsense or prophecy.


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Chapter: Darkness awakens Pt.3


Back inside the hutch, Delphox traces her wand over a constellation chart.

Greninja watches quietly, arms crossed.

| “You don’t actually see the future,” he mutters. “You calculate possible paths.”

Delphox nods without looking up.

| “Exactly. I glimpse forks in the stream, not the destination. The future isn't fixed—it’s a woven cloth of choices.”

She taps one path in the chart.

| “But the past… I can replay that as many times as I want. Every cause leaves an echo.”

Greninja steps closer, placing a hand on her shoulder.

| “That’s what makes you real. You don’t preach fate—you read patterns.”

Delphox smiles faintly. “And what I see now… is a dark stitch threading the city.”


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


Chapter: Darkness awakens Pt.4


Later that rainy night, two cloaked figures dart through the shadows of the countryside—Ceruledge and his brother Armarouge, twin bandits known for raids on abandoned outposts and forgotten shrines.

Tonight, their eyes are set on something more dangerous: the newly risen Dark Castle.

| “You sure this place ain’t cursed?” Armarouge whispers.

| “Cursed or not, rich weirdos always got relics,” Ceruledge replies, blades flickering faintly in the rain.

Inside, they sneak past the eerie halls… until a thunderous echo halts them.

A voice.
A promise.
A sales pitch.

| “Fortune. Power. No more crumbs.”

They peek past a broken archway and freeze. There it is—Rayquaza, his fourth incarnation, spiraling in place like a mirage—while Darkrai watches from the balcony above, eyes glowing.

| “I knew rats would find their way here,” Darkrai says. “You’re lucky I need rats.”

Ceruledge draws a blade. Armarouge flares with flame—but then the room darkens into a choking haze of shadow.

“Either serve me quietly, or scream and become fertilizer.”

The two exchange glances… and kneel.


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


Chapter: Darkness awakens Pt.5


The next day, inside Delphox’s cozy, lantern-lit hutch, a young couple—Vaporeon and Flaeron—sat nervously before the fortune teller and her partner, Greninja. They had come to ask how to make their upcoming school prom date unforgettable.

Delphox was about to respond warmly, but Greninja entered the room with damp steps and a colder air.

| “We have bigger things to worry about,” he said, nodding to Delphox.

The atmosphere shifted. The fox’s fur bristled slightly as she realized what he meant.

| “It’s about him, isn’t it?” she asked.

Vaporeon, though surprised, tried to ease the mood.

| “You two are like the reverse of us—Firegirl and Waterboy!”

Delphox giggled lightly, tail swaying, but Greninja stayed stoic, gazing toward the stormy skies beyond the window.

Suddenly, the door creaked open, revealing a visitor in a glimmering pink cloak—Wigglytuff, now a beloved celebrity singer, who had overheard from outside.

| “Did someone say Darkrai?”

The room quieted.

| “Tell me everything.”

-

Delphox quietly pulled out her enchanted crystal orb, glowing dim blue under the rain-filtered light. She waved her hand—and the past came alive in a misty vision:

Darkrai, once a shady street corner fortune teller, wearing a crooked monocle and too much flair, once scammed Absol into trusting a fraudulent opportunity—Rayquaza’s first gacha machine. Then came Tyranitar, heartbroken and vulnerable, seeking love advice.

| "Go flirt with the hammer girl," Darkrai had advised slyly.

It ended disastrously. Tinkaton bashed him. Tyranitar raged. He demolished Darkrai’s booth, cursed him out in a storm of vulgarity, and enslaved him, chaining him beside a cage holding Espeon, as penance.

-

The vision faded.

| “Dang,” said Flaeron. “My mom had it rough back then…”

Wigglytuff, visibly shaken, clenched her hands.

| “So he really went that far…”

She turned with resolve. “I’m going to find him.”

Greninja stepped in front of her, arms crossed.

| “You’ll get yourself killed.”

| “We should just tell Tyranitar,” Vaporeon suggested.

Delphox shook her head.

| “He doesn’t listen to fortune tellers anymore.”

Realizing the danger, the eevee couple left to inform their parents.

Meanwhile, Wigglytuff knew who would take her seriously—Gardevoir and Lucario.

Word spread fast. Soon, Wanted Posters were issued:

DARKRAI — HIGH THREAT
CERULEDGE & ARMAROUGE — WANTED DEAD OR ALIVE

On the outskirts of town, bounty flames lit in the distance.
Blaziken, long-time hunter of the twin bandits, cracked his knuckles as he read the posters.

| “Great... dis gonna be fun.”


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


Chapter: Darkness awakens Pt.6


One rainy afternoon, Greninja met up with his old squad—Coach Cinderace and Archer Sniper Decidueye—inside Charizard’s Butcher Grill Restaurant. They gathered at the back booth, far from the bustle of lunchtime.

Greninja pulled out a weathered scroll and unrolled it across the table.
The bold text read: “WANTED: DARKRAI – EXTREMELY DANGEROUS”
Beneath it, the shadowy figure's sinister grin glared back.

Cinderace, casually munching on a peeled carrot, narrowed his eyes.

| “Darkrai, huh? Figures he’d be back. Guy’s pure rot.”
| He looked around at the meat-packed menu and whispered, “Still can't believe you all eat this... I’m vegan, you know.”

Meanwhile, Decidueye picked at a roasted Skiddo skewer, but the moment his eyes caught the poster, he froze mid-chew. His pupils shrank.

| “T-that face…” he stammered, before spitting the meat into a napkin.
| “He almost killed me during the Archery Regionals… snuck up mid-match. If Machamp hadn’t tackled him by accident while jogging, I’d be a memory right now…”

Charizard, who had been grilling in the open kitchen, overheard the conversation while seasoning a slab of Tauros ribs. He turned, lowering his shades.

| “You said Darkrai?” he asked.

Greninja nodded silently and slid one of the posters across the table.

Charizard took it, studied the face, and grunted.

| “Leave me a few copies. If he steps in here— I’m cooking him next.”

Greninja smirked slightly.

| “Don’t undercook him. He’s a tough one.”


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


Chapter: Darkness awakens Pt.7


In the quiet garden behind Glaceon’s manor, the rain had left everything smelling fresh. Leafeon was pruning overgrown mint while Absol, wearing a straw hat a size too small, helped replant some azalea bulbs.

Just then, Vaporeon rushed in, her tail still dripping.

| “You need to be careful,” she said in a low voice. “Darkrai’s back. He’s planning something big.”

Glaceon set down her tea glass.

| “Darkrai? Here? After all this time?”

Absol’s ears twitched. He stood up slowly, wiping dirt from his claws.

| “...I knew it,” he muttered. “I had a feeling the air was off lately.”

They turned to him, surprised.

| “You knew him?” Glaceon asked.

Absol nodded, looking away.

| “A long time ago. I was broke, desperate. Darkrai pitched me this ‘golden investment’ in something called the Rayquasa Resurgence Machine… Said it’d pay out tenfold. It was a lie. I lost everything. My job. My pride. Even my den.”

Leafeon frowned, gently patting Absol’s shoulder.

| “You don’t have to go into it—”

| “No, it’s fine,” Absol cut in. “I need to own that mistake. Just… if he’s really back, don’t trust a single word he says.”

Meanwhile, not far away by a frosted snack cart, Pikachu handed a popsicle to a child Eevee. He had overheard most of it while pretending to refill the cooler.

He sighed, taking a bite of his own berry bar.

| “That mess again? Man, not my circus, not my Rayquasa…”

But his eyes lingered on the garden. He couldn’t quite stop watching.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Chapter: Darkness awakens Pt.8

Back at the city center, a familiar fluffy shape rushed through the wet streets—Flareon, holding a big umbrella that clearly wasn’t his. His tail was soaked, but his paws gripped the handle with purpose.

He burst through the back door of Espeon and Umbreon’s townhouse, water splashing off his fur.

| “Mom! Dad! It’s Darkrai— he’s back!”

Espeon, sipping tea on the couch, stiffened. Her teacup clinked sharply onto the saucer. Her eyes stared ahead, unfocused—memories of that cage… that cold silence…

Umbreon stood immediately, putting an arm around her.
Flareon rushed in close, lowering the umbrella and letting it drip beside the door.

| “I heard it from Vaporeon and Delphox. He’s planning something.”

Umbreon looked grim, nodding.

| “Then we don’t wait. We prepare.”

He kissed Espeon’s forehead softly.

| “I’ll secure the hospital.”

Within the hour, Umbreon had returned to his clinic. Snorlax and Swampert took their stations at the front gates—pillars of unshakable muscle. Clefable, clipboard in hand, quietly activated a series of hidden surveillance runes from the nurse’s station.

Meanwhile, Espeon summoned help to her library. Goodra, gentle but formidable, stationed herself at the rare books wing. Chesnaught held post by the front doors like a knight of old. Duraludon, stoic and silent, monitored the magical field scanner in the atrium.

The once-peaceful city was no longer asleep. It remembered.


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

GORE AND SHIT WARNING!!!


Chapter: Rodent Sh*tstorms


One cloudy afternoon, Darkrai snuck up to Charizard’s restaurant and plopped down a shady-looking arcade machine labeled “DREAM ROULETTE”— all flashy lights, creepy chiptune music, and a giant smiling Rayquaza sticker on it. It hummed with dark energy, but looked just innocent enough to fool a certain curious rodent…

Enter Greedent, off-duty from Tyranitar’s manor and waddling around looking for snacks. He spotted the machine and immediately thought: “Free food dispenser?” He slapped the start button with both paws.

ZAP! The screen flashed, a tiny neon Rayquaza spiraled out and zapped straight into Greedent’s head. Greedent froze, eyes spiraling, then dropped like a sack of potatoes.

Inside his head: two weeks of dreamland chaos. He was a billionaire, king of snacks, emperor of hoarding. But slowly, the dream twisted—his pile of berries turned to stones, fans into angry mob, his crown into a toilet seat.

BAM! He jolted awake, only 5 minutes passed. But now he was screaming about taxes and jellybeans, panicked and dizzy, spinning in circles—then accidentally dropped a massive load right in front of Charizard’s front door.

Charizard walked out, saw the mess, and went full Gordon Ramsay. “ARE YOU KIDDING ME?!”

Greedent squealed and ran away, slipping and skidding across the street— only to get splatted comically into Ceruledge’s passing scooter windshield, leaving a classic cartoon-shaped smear and falling into a trash can with a dramatic CLANG.

Ho-Oh, watching from a rooftop, sighed deeply. “Again?”

He flapped down, resurrected the dizzy Greedent with a sparkle, who blinked and muttered, “...I think I saw bacon in the sky…”

Charizard: “You’re banned. Forever.”

Meanwhile, back at his creepy perch, Darkrai facepalmed and muttered, “This is not how nightmares are supposed to work.” He quietly wheeled out a second machine labeled “VOLUME II: NIGHT TERRORS” and muttered, “Next victim…”

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUICIDE WARNING!!


Chapter: Wilting Haunted Tree Pt.1


Bright sunny morning. Birds chirping, flowers blooming, and in the middle of it all—Trevenant’s haunted-looking garden, where spooky vines curl around cheerful birdbaths and jack-o’-lanterns hum lullabies.

While Trevenant prunes a wailing rose bush, a suspiciously flashy arcade machine sparkles into view beside a crooked stump. It hums, blinks, and flashes: “DREAM ROULETTE—FREE PLAY!”

Trevenant squints. “Huh… that’s… festive?”

He creaks over, presses a viney finger on the button—ZAP! A neon Mini-Rayquaza zaps into his head.

Inside the dream: Trevenant is suddenly rich, tossing golden acorns, Tsareena blowing kisses, paparazzi snapping pics. But just as he poses for a glamour shot—crash! Tsareena dumps him, the crowd boos, and his wallet eats itself. Cue a spiral of rejection, financial ruin, and loneliness.

Five minutes later, real world: Trevenant jolts awake, lets out a slow, "nnnnoooo…", and begins wobbling like a tree in a hurricane.

Then… “Maybe I’m just a spooky shrub with no drip…”

Darkrai, hidden behind a scarecrow, whispers in his head: “Kill urself lol. You’re literally built like a cursed celery stick.”

Trevenant, crushed and spiraling, creaks toward the nearby river and yeets himself in, trying to soak into oblivion—“Overwatering ends it all…”

BUT! Just before full submersion—

Lapras slides in with a tidal wave and catches him on her back.

Suicune runs across the water like an ethereal deer and kicks Trevenant out of the river like a soggy football.

Lapras: “Are you trying to drown in broad daylight?!”

Suicune (stern): “Explain. Now.”

Trevenant, soggy and leaking leaves, points weakly toward the cursed machine still blinking in his garden: “That arcade… thing… lied to me… stole my joy…”

Lapras and Suicune exchange a look.

Suicune: “We’re gonna need river fences and depression sensors.”

Lapras: “And maybe get Slowking to start a mental health hotline…”

Meanwhile, from a dark cloud above, Darkrai sighs: “Okay, that almost worked… next location: the daycare.”


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


Chapter: Wilting Haunted Tree Pt.2


Scene: A lazy afternoon at the riverside.

Slowbro, reclining in a floaty chair made of logs, sipping coconut juice with a tiny umbrella in it. He's technically on duty as a lifeguard, but mostly napping and muttering things like, "If they don't wanna live, they ain't gonna swim."

Suddenly —SPLOOSH!— Suicune flings a soaked, leaf-drooping Trevenant right past Slowbro’s floaty.

Slowbro blinks once. “...Was that salad trying to drown?”

Five minutes later…

-

Scene: Pokémon Hospital.
Doctor Umbreon, as usual, stands dignified at the front desk, clipboard ready, looking 100% done with everyone’s problems.

Slowbro drags in Trevenant in a wheelbarrow made of driftwood. “Yo, fix him. For free.”

Umbreon (blinks slowly): “You again…”

Tension fills the room.

| Flashback bubble: Two young Pokémon arguing over who gets the last Pecha Berry in kindergarten, ending with Slowbro slapping Umbreon with a wet tail.

Back to present.

Umbreon: “I don’t work for freeloaders.”

Slowbro: “At least I don’t faint from tickles, you overgrown Roomba!”

Trevenant groans from the wheelbarrow, lifts a limp branch. “Pl… please don’t fight… I’ll pay…”

Umbreon raises an eyebrow. “Very well. Room 3. Mental Detox Chamber.”

-

Later, after Trevenant’s wheeled off, Slowbro stays behind and smugly leans on the counter.

Slowbro: “Y’know, even with all your books and flashlights, you still can’t tank a single Focus Blast.”

Umbreon (without looking up): “And yet you need a Shellder just to remember how to walk.”

The tension crackles.

Suddenly—BOOM.
Snorlax falls from the ceiling like a living meteor, bounces once, and pancakes Slowbro straight out of the building like a rubber ball.

Snorlax (grunting): “Hospital rules. No rival slap-fests.”

Umbreon: sips Oran juice and resumes paperwork “Next patient.”

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


Chapter: Amnesia vs Firebomber


Scene: Grimy alleyway behind the hospital district.

Slowbro, still steaming from being Snorlax-launched, grumbles to himself while holding his cracked shell, leaving a faint trail of slime and blood. He walks right into Armarouge, who's leaning against a dumpster tossing a fireball between his hands like a coin.

Armarouge (smirking): “You’re that meathead from the hospital, right? Heard you got booted by that Umbreon freak. Same guy who screwed over my boss.”

Slowbro (scratching his chin): “Huh... Umbreon... Yeah, I hate that guy…”

Armarouge (snickering): “Then maybe you should stop healing his friends and start burning his bridges.”

Slowbro just shrugs and waddles off. Armarouge narrows his eyes.

BOOM. The alley explodes behind Slowbro—flames and shrapnel flying—but the pink tank stumbles out of the smoke, scorched but alive, dripping blood and fury.

Slowbro (monotone): “That was rude.”

He lifts his arms, and his shell glows faintly purple—telekinesis hurls Armarouge against the wall. Trash cans scatter. The two square off.

Armarouge, with a grin, lobs a Flamethrower, but MISFIRES—

The flame arcs wide and slams into Mamoswine, who was walking across the street holding an umbrella for his wife, Alolan Ninetales.

Mamoswine (growling): “You WHAT?!”

He blocks the blast, tusks steaming, but ends up bruised. Ninetales whimpers, backing behind him.

Armarouge (realizing): “Uh… wasn’t aiming for you…”

Back to Slowbro, who's now on one knee—his telekinesis flickering, blood pouring from the shell crack. He lifts his hand weakly—

And collapses, flat on the pavement.

Just as the tension spikes—rainbow light descends from above.
Ho-Oh, as if on cue, floats down and taps Slowbro with divine grace.

Slowbro gasps awake.
Ho-Oh (calmly): “That’s once.”

Armarouge is gone. Fled during the resurrection glow.
Mamoswine checks on Ninetales. They walk away quietly.

Slowbro (blinking): “What the shell just happened…”


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


Chapter: Amnesia vs Sugarcoated dreams

Scene: Somewhere near the closed amusement park ruins, mid-day.

Slowbro, still limping from the earlier explosion and with a small bandage on his cracked shell, squints at a weird machine humming beside a broken gumball dispenser.
A large sticker reads: "TRY ME! Get Rich Quick in Dreams!"
The "i" in “Rayquasa” is dotted with a star. Clearly cursed.

Slowbro (blank stare): “…meh.”

He kicks it. Bad move.
A mini-Rayquasa emerges and rockets into his face like a mosquito.
Dream machine activated.

-

Inside Slowbro’s mind — 2 dream weeks compressed into 5 real minutes:

Slowbro, now buff, rich, and standing on a pile of cash, laughs while being fed berries by a harem of blushing Pokémon girls.
Espeon clings to his arm whispering, “Umbreon never paid attention like this…”

Gardevoir throws petals.
Tinkaton rants about how Ttar just “doesn’t understand softness.”
Tsareena... just kind of walks away halfway through.
Slowbro (dream): “Bruh.”

He turns on a crystal ball and loads Porkyman.net—somehow a real website in the dream.
He scrolls casually.

-

Reality — 5 minutes later:

Still dazed, Slowbro stumbles down the sidewalk, phone still out, drooling.
Without looking, he walks headfirst into Mimikyu, owner of the local daycare.

Mimikyu (deadpan): “...What the hell is this content?”

She yanks the phone, closes the browser with her ghostly tendrils, and frowns deeply.
Children peek from the windows.

Mimikyu (ominous): “Daycare is for babies, not whatever that site was.”

Slowbro (smiling doofily): “Heh. Bonk.”

Mimikyu sighs, takes his hand, and drags him inside.

-

Meanwhile, in the castle...

Darkrai, watching the footage through ghostly monitors, facepalms hard enough to knock a candle over.

Darkrai (grumbling): “WHAT is WRONG with these people...”

He turns to Armarouge, who’s stretching near the wall.

Darkrai: “100 squats. Now. You put that one near daycare. Do you WANT me on another watchlist?!”

Armarouge (groaning): “Bruh…”

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


Chapter: Daycare and Innocent Dreams


Scene: Mimikyu's Daycare, cozy, quiet.

Mimikyu hums eerily while preparing ghost pancakes for the kids.
Slowbro sits in the corner watching kids' cartoons with an unblinking smile.

Little Dreepy Boy, curious and restless, waddles outside to the play area.
There it is — the nightmare machine, glowing faintly behind the bushes, still sticky with "Slowbro drool."
Before Mimikyu notices—boop.

Dreepy gets absorbed.

-

Inside the dream (2 weeks in his head):

Dreepy is flying again, happy and warm in his mother Goodra's slimey embrace.
They’re picnicking under a rainbow, with soft harp music and sparkles.

Dreepy (tearing up): "Mommy... you’re back..."

Goodra (dream version): "I missed you, sweetheart..."

He laughs, spins, and floats in mid-air like a balloon on joy juice.

-

5 minutes pass in real life.

He wakes up with little tears in his eyes, sniffles, and calls out:

Dreepy: "Goodra-mommy…"

One of the Goomies nearby (his half-sister): "Mommy??"

All the baby Dragons look up. Even Slowbro snaps out of cartoon trance.

Mimikyu: “Uh-oh.”

-

Cut to: Dragapult, just outside the daycare in a shabby delivery outfit, holding a takeout bag labeled “Flareon’s Spicy Grill.”
He peers through the daycare window, watching his son cry for Goodra.

Dragapult (monologue): "...I should’ve fed that Rayquaza... I should’ve protected my family..."

Just as he sighs, Goodra happens to stroll by, arms full of groceries. She hears the cries of "Mommy!" and freezes.

She sees the daycare, sees Dragapult... and the moment hits like a Hyper Beam of emotion.

Groceries drop. Slime glistens. She walks forward.

-

Inside daycare, seconds later:

Door creaks open. Goodra walks in slowly.

Dreepy’s eyes widen.
Goomy gasps.
Dragapult drops his hat.

They hug like it’s the last episode of a soap opera. The room fills with soft Dragon energy sparkles.

Goodra (teary): “I only left to save enough to feed you…”

Dragapult (softly): “Then let’s feed them together…”

They kiss. Dreepy and Goomy cheer.

Slowbro (sniffling): “Happy slime...”

-

Meanwhile, far away in the shadows of his glitchy monitor room...

Darkrai watches this wholesome drama.

He hurls a chair at the wall.

Darkrai: "WHY?! I PUT THAT MACHINE IN A DUMPY CORNER!! THIS WAS SUPPOSED TO TRAUMATIZE HIM!"

Armarouge (doing push-ups, again): “You said not near a daycare this time…”

Darkrai: “THAT WAS A TECHNICALITY!!”


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

JOJO references INCOMING!!!


Chapter: Nightclub Brawls Pt.1


Scene: Inteleon's Club Pub Bar – Neon, smoky, jazzy ambiance.

Incineroar leans back on the couch, one paw on a drink, the other around Meowscarada, who's on stage doing a sultry Poké-dance routine to a slowed-down remix of "Porkyman Anthem."

Outside, Buzzwole patrols with pride, veins glistening under the streetlight, flexing with each step like he's modeling for an invisible camera.

Then — he spots it.

A suspicious machine with a shiny bottle of alcohol attached.

Buzzwole (reading sign aloud):
“Drink to see dreams of greatness.”

He shrugs.

Buzzwole: “Buzz needs dreamzzz... and buzz.”

He downs the alcohol in one chug, then punches the machine with a bellowing "YEAAAH!"
Zzzzap.
Mini Rayquaza absorbed him.

-

Buzzwole’s Nightmare (2 weeks in his head):

He becomes rich, worshipped, and surrounded by baddies — Tsareena, Lilligant, Lopunny, and even Meowscarada.
He flexes with Tyranitar’s charisma, married again to Pheromosa. Everyone calls him Buzz Daddy.

But then—

Divorce papers.
Backstabs.
Lawsuits.
Tsareena leaves him for real Ttar.
His muscles shrink.
Pheromosa laughs.
Everything burns.
“NOOOO!”

-

Back in real life — 5 minutes later.

Buzzwole wakes up, drunk on dreamlust, trembling with rage and delusion.

Buzzwole (snarling): “It’s MY club now!”

He smashes into the pub, uppercuts Incineroar, who slams into a beer keg and goes limp.

Inteleon (panicking): “HOLY– SOMEONE CALL–!”

-

Cue: Squeal of tires.

Machamp & Miraidon arrive in a screech, drifting to a halt.

Buzzwole roars, grabs Meowscarada, and ties her with neon rope from the club decor.
He licks his lips, posing in front of the tied dancer.

Machamp (cracking all four knuckles): “You messed with the wrong gym.”

Buzzwole (flexes): “WRYYYYYY!!”

-

Cue epic Jojo-style fight:

- Machamp: “ORA ORA ORA ORA!!”

- Buzzwole: “MUDA MUDA MUDA MUDA!!”

Fists blur. Beams crack walls. Bar gets wrecked.

Inteleon tries to sneak away, but Buzzwole punches through the bar counter, draining his life with Leech Life.
Inteleon screams and collapses — dead.

-

Miraidon: “Enough!!”

He launches in full speed, electric wheels blazing, and slams into Buzzwole's gut, oozing green blood onto the dancefloor.

Buzzwole stumbles, roaring in pain, but retaliates by punting Miraidon across the room.

But...

Machamp lands behind him and delivers a final barrage —
“ORAORAORAORAORAORAORA!!”

Buzzwole crashes through the stage and collapses unconscious.

-

Ho-Oh swoops down, shimmering in rainbow light.

He sees the scene — blood, broken lights, twitching bodies — and revives Inteleon with a glowing feather.

Inteleon (weakly): “…ow…”

-

Meowscarada (untied, shaken):
“Ho-Oh… that machine… it had alcohol… and it’s not the only one.”

Ho-Oh (nodding grimly):
“I will inform the Guardians. This is no longer an isolated prank.”

She pulls out her phone and tries to call Tyranitar…

Cut to: Ttar asleep on his lab couch, phone buzzing unanswered, snoring.

-

Scene fades to black.

Darkrai, watching it all unfold from the shadows, whispers:

“One... by one...”


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


Chapter: Nightclub Brawls Pt.2


Scene: Luxurious Golden Courtroom – "Justice Fortress" inside Tyranitar’s Manor

Gilded walls, marble floors, and a massive diamond gavel sit in front of the Honorary Judge:
Dressy Tinkaton, in her most fashionable suit-dress hybrid, swinging her gavel like she means business.

Buzzwole, shackled in chains, stands in the middle — defiant, bloodied but still flexing, surrounded by security with Machamp.

In the crowd:

- CEO Bodyguard Tyranitar, arms crossed, glaring.

- Meowscarada, seated beside Incineroar, arms bandaged.

- Dragonite, serving tea and holding evidence files.

- Pheromosa, sitting coldly across the courtroom in a velvet seat, legs crossed and eyes sharp.

- Inteleon, patched up, sunglasses on, flipping through documents smugly.

-

Dressy Tinkaton (slamming gavel):
“Court is now in session. Buzzwole, you stand accused of bar destruction, attempted kidnapping, first-degree ‘horny assault’, and the death — temporary — of bartender Inteleon.”

Buzzwole (scoffing):
“I did what I wanted. I don’t regret it. I’m Buzz. I don’t apologize.”

Meowscarada:
“You’re a freak. Go back to your sick daydreams.”

Buzzwole (grinning):
“You were in them too, sweetheart.”

Incineroar growls. Tyranitar punches his own hand.

Tyranitar (deep voice):
“Buzz, you’re a disgrace to all hired muscle. You’re not a bodyguard. You’re a body liability.”

Buzzwole:
“Then make me shut up!”

Tinkaton stands.
“Gladly.”

She swings her gavel — it turns into a warhammer. Buzzwole dodges.

Tyranitar smashes Buzzwole into the floor from the side.

Pheromosa (calmly walking up, heels clicking):
“I left you for a reason.”

She spin-kicks him in the face. Buzzwole rolls over, groaning.

-

Final Verdict:

- 2 years prison sentence, with full toilet cleaning duty across Tyranitar’s manor.

- Chains are laced with micro-explosives if he even tries to leave the perimeter.

- Also banned permanently from Meowscarada’s presence and any club or bar in the region.

- Forced to listen to Pheromosa’s breakup playlist on loop in his cell.

-

As Buzzwole is dragged out screaming:

Buzzwole:
“I’LL BE BACK!! I’LL BE– wait this isn’t even flushable– AAAAAAARGH!”

Meowscarada:
“Trash belongs in the bin.”

Inteleon lights a cig, sighing.
“Justice tastes like smoke and salt.”

Chapter: Poolside Paradise turned Devonian Disaster



Greninja and Delphox sit on the edge of the crystal-clear pool, feet in the water. Nearby, Flareon and Vaporeon are playfully splashing each other while sharing chilled Pecha smoothies. The mood? Romantic chaos.

Delphox (slipping):
“Whoops—!”
Splash.

Greninja (catching her bridal-style again):
“Third time this hour.”

Vaporeon (carrying Flareon out from another accidental cannonball):
“Don’t worry, mine’s just as flammable.”

The two couples laugh until Delphox narrows her eyes toward a strange machine beside the juice stand — glowing faintly, eerie hum pulsing.

Delphox:
“That's... one of his.”

Greninja (nods seriously):
“Darkrai.”

Delphox:
“Let's not poke it. Take notes, leave it to someone expendable.”

-

Meanwhile...

Gyarados, the giant lifeguard lounging lazily nearby, overhears them while sunbathing.

Gyarados (grumbling):
“Machine? Ugh. Lemme handle it like a man-fish.”

He stomps over and headbutts the machine.
Mini-Rayquaza absorbs him.

Five minutes later...
He bursts into the indoor meeting room, eyes glowing, roaring in ancient fish tongue, and floods the building, imagining it as a Devonian aquatic paradise with jawless fish citizens and trilobite floaties.

-

Delphox and Flareon start to choke from the rushing water, but—

- Greninja bridal-swims Delphox up the current.

- Vaporeon grabs Flareon, riding a hydro vortex upward.

They escape just as Gyarados snaps out of it mid-roar:

Gyarados (panicking):
“Oh Carp—WHAT HAPPENED?!”

Realizing what he did, Gyarados bows to Greninja.

Gyarados (groveling):
“I’ll pay—everything! Please don’t tell the Water Type Council... or the cops. Especially not the cops!”

-

Meanwhile nearby…

Goodra bridal-carries Dragapult while gliding along a skywalk path.

Goodra (smiling, sees Vaporeon bridal-carrying Flareon):
“Aww… that’s adorable.”

Dragapult (spots Flareon):
“Hey, fire-boy! You used to deliver my spicy rolls!”

Flareon:
“Still got your tip, old man!”

They laugh and head together toward Espeon’s Library, unaware that more dark machines are spreading behind the scenes.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


Chapter: Espeon’s Library – Cozy and peaceful... until it isn’t.


Espeon lounges behind the main desk with a cup of Roseli tea, scrolling through Porkyman fanfic of Umbreon— her husband— on the staff laptop. Just as she mutters, “Why does everyone ship him with Zoroark...”—

Dragapult silently phases through the wall.

Dragapult (casual):
“Hey.”

Espeon (SCREAMING):
“WAAAAAAH—!!”

She launches herself into the air—only to be caught bridal-style by Umbreon, who had just arrived with a stack of books.

Umbreon (dryly):
“Reading my fanfics again?”

Espeon (grumbling):
“They wrote you like some edgy beefcake— it's weirdly accurate.”

Dragapult (sweating ghost bullets):
“Uh. Sorry. Just came to say: there’s another of those nightmare machines. Gyarados went feral at the pool. Delphox barely made it.”

Espeon snaps into action, cracking her psychic fingers and slamming open her laptop.

Espeon:
“PsychicNet, EspHub, Twibird, I’m lighting all of them up— this machine nonsense ends now.”

-

In the background, Flareon (their son) and his girlfriend Vaporeon are organizing books and helping scan library IDs. They overhear the convo, and Vaporeon immediately starts taking photos of the warning notice. Flareon pulls up the library's comms and uploads it to school, local, and emergency groups.

Vaporeon (focused):
“This should go viral by lunch. #DarkraiMachine is trending.”

Flareon:
“Let’s get the word to our teachers too— maybe even the mayor.”

-

Goodra walks by with a grocery bag, overhearing it all.

Goodra:
“If we’re doing favors— Dragapult, sweetie, mind delivering lunch again? Spicy Kelp Dumplings, plus berry salad. Flareon, you’re fire, so make sure it’s hot!”

Flareon (salutes):
“Yes ma’am!”

Umbreon (dad mode):
“And if I catch one more sugar-drenched slowpoke bun, you’re grounded until next evolution.”

Espeon (giggling):
“You say that like it’s a threat, but last time you grounded him, he evolved with extra fluff.”

Flareon (embarrassed):
“Mommmm...”

-

As the team scatters to do their part, somewhere in the shadows, Darkrai stares at trending posts online...

Darkrai:
“They’re going viral over a terror device? No. No no no—this was supposed to be NIGHTMARE, not NOSTALGIA CORE.”

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Chapter: Tyranitar's Apathy

Scene: Tyranitar’s Luxury Office – CEO of WarioWare Inc.

Tyranitar lounges on his reinforced platinum chair, eating gold-leaf-topped snacks while scrolling through his massive triple monitor setup. On screen: #DarkraiMachine, now the top trending topic in the region.

Tyranitar (chuckling):
“Pfft. ‘Nightmare machines’? What’s next—Gengar doing taxes? Please. Probably just another prank for views.”

He kicks back and nearly tips his desk.

-

Tinkaton, standing nearby with a worried frown and her hammer resting against her shoulder, watches the newsfeed as well. Her pink eyes narrow.

Tinkaton:
“This... doesn’t feel fake, honey. Too many cases. The hospital, the pool, even that daycare... kids were crying about their ‘melty brains.’”

Tyranitar (shrugging):
“Bah. Probably some fairy soap drama. Unless it’s making me money, it ain’t real.”

-

Tinkaton, clearly done with her boss’s apathy, pulls out her phone and dials Detective Gardevoir.

Tinkaton (firmly):
“Gardevoir. It’s Tinka. I need you to investigate this nightmare machine trend. It’s turning real ugly. Bring Lucario.”

-

Meanwhile – Gardevoir & Lucario’s Apartment

Lucario is doing dishes, while Gardevoir floats upside-down on the couch with a psychic magnifying glass, browsing old case files.

Phone rings.
Gardevoir picks up, eyes instantly sharp.

Gardevoir:
“On it.”

Lucario (dryly):
“What now, another regional catastrophe?”

Gardevoir (floating upright):
“Potential psychic warfare, dream-based assault, and viral mass panic.”

Lucario:
“Yep. Regional catastrophe.”

They grab their coats.

-

Later That Day – City Sirens Blare

Screens across the city flash with “CODE NIGHTMARE – REPORT SUSPICIOUS ARCADE DEVICES” warnings. Helicopters buzz the skies. Police forces are on alert. Hospitals and libraries are locking down.

Everyone’s taking action.

Everyone... except Tyranitar.

Tyranitar (sipping expensive tea):
“Y’all are sheep. Bet next week it’s ‘Mimikyu turns people into plushies.’”

Suddenly, his office lights flicker.

He stops sipping.
