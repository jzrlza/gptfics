Darkrai is the main antagonist in this saga.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


Prolouge: 200 years of darkness alone

Just after Darkrai got whack-a-moled by Tinkaton and before Gengar’s redemption…

Darkrai had been asleep for 200 years—but only in a dream, locked inside his own mental prison.
By year 69 of the dream sentence, he began plotting revenge against all Pokémon. His thoughts formed a twisted vision... a company logo:
"TIMI TIMMY Co."

Even in his vengeful haze, Darkrai cringed at the absurdity of the name.
Still, something about it pulled him forward. Using mental energy, he projected himself—far from the city—marking a site for the construction of a Dark Castle Lair, the predicted respawn point of the next gacha-machine.

By year 200, he awakened in the real world. Months passed as he quietly built the castle and conducted obscure research.
And then... it happened.
After Mime’s defeat, and Rayquaza’s third death, the gacha machine respawned—exactly as he foresaw.

But Darkrai wasn’t ready yet.
He spent more months preparing, studying the mechanics, digging through corrupted AI scripts and glitchy summon lore.

Now—after the peace of the beach day fades—Darkrai finally completes the final key: control.
Rayquaza, the scammy dragon, is released again for the fourth time.



-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Prolouge: 4th time's the charm

Rayquaza 4.0 – the MLM Pitcher Supreme

The fourth resurrection of Rayquaza, born from Darkrai’s post-dream recalibration, is no longer the fragile flashy dragon of old.
Rayquaza 4.0 still peddles lootboxes and probability-rigged banners with the fervor of a cult leader at a tech expo—but now, he’s structurally altered.

This version is:

- More resilient to Tyranitar’s one-shot finisher, having been remade with anti-Dark Pulse plating and “plot armor firmware.”

- Built with passive income logic loops, able to auto-sell banners while speaking.

- Still flashy, still loud, but now harder to meme out of existence.

Darkrai stands in the shadows, watching his MLM beast emerge, whispering,

| “This time, the scam is eternal.”

Chapter: Darkness awakens Pt.1


Rain falls like whispers of dread.
Outskirts of the city—Bounty Hunter Greninja, cloaked in soaked shadows, tightens the scarf around his mouth. His quiet stroll halts as he sees it:
A dark castle, jagged and unnatural, oozing with black-purple energy.

From inside:
A cringeworthy pitch echoes,

| “LIMITED-TIME RAID PACK! DOUBLE THE DROP RATES—TRIPLE THE REGRET!”
| followed by Darkrai’s chilling laugh, warped by years of isolation and ego.

Greninja narrows his eyes. “He’s back…”

Without hesitation, he disappears into a water log mist. He must warn the city—and more importantly, Fortune Teller Delphox, his trusted partner and love.

She saw this coming. She always does.

Chapter: Darkness awakens Pt.2


Inside Delphox’s warm hutch, candles flicker beside tarot cards and herbal incense.
Tsareena sits across from Delphox, her legs crossed like roots in meditation.

| “If you plant the mangosteen seed with care,” Delphox says gently, “especially during this rainy moon, your harvest will double. Twice the yield. | Twice the coin.”

Tsareena smiles, intrigued—until the door swings open with a sudden burst of wind.

Greninja steps in, dripping with rain, eyes sharp. “He’s back. The dark dreamer.”

Tsareena blinks. “Who?”

Delphox, with no hesitation:

| “Darkrai. He’s building again. And this time… the machine speaks.”

Greninja nods. “The scam-pitch castle’s no illusion. He’s baiting the city.”

Delphox closes her eyes. “There is only one Pokémon who can finish him. Tyranitar’s rocky hands… the prophecy’s final card. But he won’t believe it.”

Tsareena, now uneasy, looks out into the storm. “Then we’re doomed?”

Delphox stands and places a hand on her shoulder. “Not if you stay dry, and keep planting. Destiny favors patience.”

Tsareena, still confused, quietly exits into the rain—mangosteen seed in hand, unsure whether she’s walking away from nonsense or prophecy.

Chapter: Darkness awakens Pt.3


Back inside the hutch, Delphox traces her wand over a constellation chart.

Greninja watches quietly, arms crossed.

| “You don’t actually see the future,” he mutters. “You calculate possible paths.”

Delphox nods without looking up.

| “Exactly. I glimpse forks in the stream, not the destination. The future isn't fixed—it’s a woven cloth of choices.”

She taps one path in the chart.

| “But the past… I can replay that as many times as I want. Every cause leaves an echo.”

Greninja steps closer, placing a hand on her shoulder.

| “That’s what makes you real. You don’t preach fate—you read patterns.”

Delphox smiles faintly. “And what I see now… is a dark stitch threading the city.”


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


Chapter: Darkness awakens Pt.4


Later that rainy night, two cloaked figures dart through the shadows of the countryside—Ceruledge and his brother Armarouge, twin bandits known for raids on abandoned outposts and forgotten shrines.

Tonight, their eyes are set on something more dangerous: the newly risen Dark Castle.

| “You sure this place ain’t cursed?” Armarouge whispers.

| “Cursed or not, rich weirdos always got relics,” Ceruledge replies, blades flickering faintly in the rain.

Inside, they sneak past the eerie halls… until a thunderous echo halts them.

A voice.
A promise.
A sales pitch.

| “Fortune. Power. No more crumbs.”

They peek past a broken archway and freeze. There it is—Rayquaza, his fourth incarnation, spiraling in place like a mirage—while Darkrai watches from the balcony above, eyes glowing.

| “I knew rats would find their way here,” Darkrai says. “You’re lucky I need rats.”

Ceruledge draws a blade. Armarouge flares with flame—but then the room darkens into a choking haze of shadow.

“Either serve me quietly, or scream and become fertilizer.”

The two exchange glances… and kneel.


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


Chapter: Darkness awakens Pt.5


The next day, inside Delphox’s cozy, lantern-lit hutch, a young couple—Vaporeon and Flaeron—sat nervously before the fortune teller and her partner, Greninja. They had come to ask how to make their upcoming school prom date unforgettable.

Delphox was about to respond warmly, but Greninja entered the room with damp steps and a colder air.

| “We have bigger things to worry about,” he said, nodding to Delphox.

The atmosphere shifted. The fox’s fur bristled slightly as she realized what he meant.

| “It’s about him, isn’t it?” she asked.

Vaporeon, though surprised, tried to ease the mood.

| “You two are like the reverse of us—Firegirl and Waterboy!”

Delphox giggled lightly, tail swaying, but Greninja stayed stoic, gazing toward the stormy skies beyond the window.

Suddenly, the door creaked open, revealing a visitor in a glimmering pink cloak—Wigglytuff, now a beloved celebrity singer, who had overheard from outside.

| “Did someone say Darkrai?”

The room quieted.

| “Tell me everything.”

-

Delphox quietly pulled out her enchanted crystal orb, glowing dim blue under the rain-filtered light. She waved her hand—and the past came alive in a misty vision:

Darkrai, once a shady street corner fortune teller, wearing a crooked monocle and too much flair, once scammed Absol into trusting a fraudulent opportunity—Rayquaza’s first gacha machine. Then came Tyranitar, heartbroken and vulnerable, seeking love advice.

| "Go flirt with the hammer girl," Darkrai had advised slyly.

It ended disastrously. Tinkaton bashed him. Tyranitar raged. He demolished Darkrai’s booth, cursed him out in a storm of vulgarity, and enslaved him, chaining him beside a cage holding Espeon, as penance.

-

The vision faded.

| “Dang,” said Flaeron. “My mom had it rough back then…”

Wigglytuff, visibly shaken, clenched her hands.

| “So he really went that far…”

She turned with resolve. “I’m going to find him.”

Greninja stepped in front of her, arms crossed.

| “You’ll get yourself killed.”

| “We should just tell Tyranitar,” Vaporeon suggested.

Delphox shook her head.

| “He doesn’t listen to fortune tellers anymore.”

Realizing the danger, the eevee couple left to inform their parents.

Meanwhile, Wigglytuff knew who would take her seriously—Gardevoir and Lucario.

Word spread fast. Soon, Wanted Posters were issued:

DARKRAI — HIGH THREAT
CERULEDGE & ARMAROUGE — WANTED DEAD OR ALIVE

On the outskirts of town, bounty flames lit in the distance.
Blaziken, long-time hunter of the twin bandits, cracked his knuckles as he read the posters.

| “Great... dis gonna be fun.”


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


Chapter: Darkness awakens Pt.6


One rainy afternoon, Greninja met up with his old squad—Coach Cinderace and Archer Sniper Decidueye—inside Charizard’s Butcher Grill Restaurant. They gathered at the back booth, far from the bustle of lunchtime.

Greninja pulled out a weathered scroll and unrolled it across the table.
The bold text read: “WANTED: DARKRAI – EXTREMELY DANGEROUS”
Beneath it, the shadowy figure's sinister grin glared back.

Cinderace, casually munching on a peeled carrot, narrowed his eyes.

| “Darkrai, huh? Figures he’d be back. Guy’s pure rot.”
| He looked around at the meat-packed menu and whispered, “Still can't believe you all eat this... I’m vegan, you know.”

Meanwhile, Decidueye picked at a roasted Skiddo skewer, but the moment his eyes caught the poster, he froze mid-chew. His pupils shrank.

| “T-that face…” he stammered, before spitting the meat into a napkin.
| “He almost killed me during the Archery Regionals… snuck up mid-match. If Machamp hadn’t tackled him by accident while jogging, I’d be a memory right now…”

Charizard, who had been grilling in the open kitchen, overheard the conversation while seasoning a slab of Tauros ribs. He turned, lowering his shades.

| “You said Darkrai?” he asked.

Greninja nodded silently and slid one of the posters across the table.

Charizard took it, studied the face, and grunted.

| “Leave me a few copies. If he steps in here—I’m cooking him next.”

Greninja smirked slightly.

| “Don’t undercook him. He’s a tough one.”
