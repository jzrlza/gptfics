Darkrai is the main antagonist in this saga.

Prolouge: 200 years of darkness alone

Just after Darkrai got whack-a-moled by Tinkaton and before Gengar’s redemption…

Darkrai had been asleep for 200 years—but only in a dream, locked inside his own mental prison.
By year 69 of the dream sentence, he began plotting revenge against all Pokémon. His thoughts formed a twisted vision... a company logo:
"TIMI TIMMY Co."

Even in his vengeful haze, Darkrai cringed at the absurdity of the name.
Still, something about it pulled him forward. Using mental energy, he projected himself—far from the city—marking a site for the construction of a Dark Castle Lair, the predicted respawn point of the next gacha-machine.

By year 200, he awakened in the real world. Months passed as he quietly built the castle and conducted obscure research.
And then... it happened.
After Mime’s defeat, and Rayquaza’s third death, the gacha machine respawned—exactly as he foresaw.

But Darkrai wasn’t ready yet.
He spent more months preparing, studying the mechanics, digging through corrupted AI scripts and glitchy summon lore.

Now—after the peace of the beach day fades—Darkrai finally completes the final key: control.
Rayquaza, the scammy dragon, is released again for the fourth time.

Prolouge: 4th time's the charm

Rayquaza 4.0 – the MLM Pitcher Supreme

The fourth resurrection of Rayquaza, born from Darkrai’s post-dream recalibration, is no longer the fragile flashy dragon of old.
Rayquaza 4.0 still peddles lootboxes and probability-rigged banners with the fervor of a cult leader at a tech expo—but now, he’s structurally altered.

This version is:

- More resilient to Tyranitar’s one-shot finisher, having been remade with anti-Dark Pulse plating and “plot armor firmware.”

- Built with passive income logic loops, able to auto-sell banners while speaking.

- Still flashy, still loud, but now harder to meme out of existence.

Darkrai stands in the shadows, watching his MLM beast emerge, whispering,

| “This time, the scam is eternal.”

Chapter: Darkness awakens Pt.1


Rain falls like whispers of dread.
Outskirts of the city—Bounty Hunter Greninja, cloaked in soaked shadows, tightens the scarf around his mouth. His quiet stroll halts as he sees it:
A dark castle, jagged and unnatural, oozing with black-purple energy.

From inside:
A cringeworthy pitch echoes,

| “LIMITED-TIME RAID PACK! DOUBLE THE DROP RATES—TRIPLE THE REGRET!”
| followed by Darkrai’s chilling laugh, warped by years of isolation and ego.

Greninja narrows his eyes. “He’s back…”

Without hesitation, he disappears into a water log mist. He must warn the city—and more importantly, Fortune Teller Delphox, his trusted partner and love.

She saw this coming. She always does.

Chapter: Darkness awakens Pt.2


Inside Delphox’s warm hutch, candles flicker beside tarot cards and herbal incense.
Tsareena sits across from Delphox, her legs crossed like roots in meditation.

| “If you plant the mangosteen seed with care,” Delphox says gently, “especially during this rainy moon, your harvest will double. Twice the yield. | Twice the coin.”

Tsareena smiles, intrigued—until the door swings open with a sudden burst of wind.

Greninja steps in, dripping with rain, eyes sharp. “He’s back. The dark dreamer.”

Tsareena blinks. “Who?”

Delphox, with no hesitation:

| “Darkrai. He’s building again. And this time… the machine speaks.”

Greninja nods. “The scam-pitch castle’s no illusion. He’s baiting the city.”

Delphox closes her eyes. “There is only one Pokémon who can finish him. Tyranitar’s rocky hands… the prophecy’s final card. But he won’t believe it.”

Tsareena, now uneasy, looks out into the storm. “Then we’re doomed?”

Delphox stands and places a hand on her shoulder. “Not if you stay dry, and keep planting. Destiny favors patience.”

Tsareena, still confused, quietly exits into the rain—mangosteen seed in hand, unsure whether she’s walking away from nonsense or prophecy.

Chapter: Darkness awakens Pt.3


Back inside the hutch, Delphox traces her wand over a constellation chart.

Greninja watches quietly, arms crossed.

| “You don’t actually see the future,” he mutters. “You calculate possible paths.”

Delphox nods without looking up.

| “Exactly. I glimpse forks in the stream, not the destination. The future isn't fixed—it’s a woven cloth of choices.”

She taps one path in the chart.

| “But the past… I can replay that as many times as I want. Every cause leaves an echo.”

Greninja steps closer, placing a hand on her shoulder.

| “That’s what makes you real. You don’t preach fate—you read patterns.”

Delphox smiles faintly. “And what I see now… is a dark stitch threading the city.”
