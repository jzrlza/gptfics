Saga 3: Rebirth of the Glitched
One year has passed since the fall of Darkrai.

The story begins within the deepest levels of Gardevoir's Black Hole prison. The five inmates—Cramorant, Mr. Mime, Buzzwole, Ceruledge, and Armarouge—have now spent a full year behind bars. Their confinement situations have changed: Mime and Cramorant are stationed in nearby hover cells, locked in place by an electrified anti-gravity system. Though not as extreme as a black hole, the shock system punishes even the slightest breach attempt.

Meanwhile, Ceruledge and Armarouge, each confined in isolated black hole zones, have slipped into mental collapse. Suicidal thoughts swirl between the once-feared bandit brothers. Both have refused food for two days, their hunger now overshadowed by hollow despair.

Buzzwole, however, remains mentally stable. Having shown signs of cooperation, he’s been moved to a brighter, more spacious room. Urshifu now visits him twice weekly, offering meditative lectures and allowing him extended time in a reinforced gym enclosure. Buzzwole listens silently—stoic, yet subtly changed.

Hover Cell Area – Mr. Mime and Cramorant

Mime leans toward Cramorant, whispering slyly.
“Ceruledge and Armarouge? Pathetic. Starving for pity. Let them rot.”

Cramorant glares back blankly, before spitting water into Mime’s face.
“I want food,” he croaks bluntly.

Unfazed, Mime levitates untouched food trays meant for the bandit brothers. They hover toward Cramorant like treasure chests. He devours them noisily. Mime smirks.

“I’ve got bigger plans. Darkrai's gone—good riddance. Tyranitar? Might be useful... if I finish the Manifest Key first.”
A loud ZZZAP cuts him off mid-sentence as a spark lashes from the cell's edge. Mime flinches, electrocuted again in comical fashion. Cram snorts a laugh, still chewing.

Mime’s Secret Unfolds

Mime has been planning. Deeply. Secretly.

He whispers cruelly about Cinderace’s “pathetic” death, and unveils his secret tools:

- Cinderbot, a robot duplicate built with full Pyro Ball and Blaze Kick capabilities.

- Mimebot, a silent mimic equipped with stealth tech and psychic shielding.

“I waited. The guard's weak. And I’ve already checked your name, Cram. You're on the list now.” Mime grins. “Help me… and I feed you forever.”

Night of the Breakout

Late one night, General Officer Machamp snores at his post.

Mimebot quietly deploys a voice-dampening cube, muting all sound within a 10-meter radius. No noise escapes. Cinderbot melts through the glass of the hover cell with a focused heat kick.

Mime floats across his platform without a sound, quickly boxing Cramorant’s head to silence his reflex squawks. The two inmates slip out, undetected. They flee into the abyss.

Return to the Lab

They arrive at Mime’s old laboratory—buried beneath rubble and dust from the old Darkspin Studios collapse. Broken screens flicker faintly, and schematics cover the cracked floor.

A terminal boots up.
On it: a list.
Two names checked off—Mime and Cinderace.
Next: Cramorant.
And below that… more names. Ominous. Unspoken. Unseen.

Mime turns toward his new sidekick.
“Let’s rebuild the future. With bots that never fail.”

Cramorant gurgles a response, already eyeing the snack bar nearby.
The lab hums to life.

At the Lab
Mime turned to Cramorant and said calmly, “This will sting a little.” He fired a blueprint-DNA dart into Cram, extracting every trace of his DNA and innate power. The dart gently released, and Mime carefully loaded the data into one of his old, dusty auto-bot builders—of which several lined the lab, though only two had been activated so far: one using Mime’s DNA, and one using Cinderace’s.

As the machine whirred to life, processing Cram’s data, Mime casually began explaining how he obtained Cinderace’s DNA long before the rabbit’s death.

Flashback – One Year Ago
It was a sunny day, still before the climax that would later ruin Tyranitar’s manor. Mime had escaped the estate undetected and wandered deep into a forgotten stretch of the sewers. There, hidden in darkness, he discovered an ominous list—a blueprint catalog of optimal DNA matches for future combat bots.

The first name on the list: Coach Cinderace.

Mime didn’t waste time. Still that very day—coincidentally, just before nightfall when Cramorant would go berserk—Mime traveled to the football stadium. Cinderace was mid-game, showing off for the crowd while his then-girlfriend, Lopunny, cheered from the stands.

Seizing the moment, Mime caught the football mid-air with his psychic powers. As Cinderace jogged up, irritated, Mime issued a quiet threat: he wouldn’t return the ball unless he could copy the rabbit’s DNA.

Cinderace reluctantly agreed—but not without lashing out. “You freak! Hope Darkrai tears you apart and paints the walls in your blood! Not even Ho-Oh could revive your twisted little head!” he spat.

Mime just smiled politely. “Your words may bite you in the back someday,” he said, then floated away.

Unseen in the crowd, an innocent Cramorant—still mentally stable—watched the encounter, head tilted in confusion. Mime, meanwhile, secretly hoped Darkrai would die, removing the last wild card from his long game.

Back to the Present
With a hiss and a flash of blue light, the Cramorant bot powered up. It resembled the original perfectly—complete with its gaping beak and unpredictable swallowing behavior—but with one major upgrade: its Water Pulse blast packed enough force to punch a hole straight through the lab wall on its first test.

Cramorant twitched, drooled, and tilted his head with a lopsided grin.
“Food buddy?” he asked, barely blinking.

Mime smirked. “Soon enough.”
