Saga 3: Glitched
One year has passed since the fall of Darkrai.

The story begins within the deepest levels of Gardevoir's Black Hole prison. The five inmates—Cramorant, Mr. Mime, Buzzwole, Ceruledge, and Armarouge—have now spent a full year behind bars. Their confinement situations have changed: Mime and Cramorant are stationed in nearby hover cells, locked in place by an electrified anti-gravity system. Though not as extreme as a black hole, the shock system punishes even the slightest breach attempt.

Meanwhile, Ceruledge and Armarouge, each confined in isolated black hole zones, have slipped into mental collapse. Suicidal thoughts swirl between the once-feared bandit brothers. Both have refused food for two days, their hunger now overshadowed by hollow despair.

Buzzwole, however, remains mentally stable. Having shown signs of cooperation, he’s been moved to a brighter, more spacious room. Urshifu now visits him twice weekly, offering meditative lectures and allowing him extended time in a reinforced gym enclosure. Buzzwole listens silently—stoic, yet subtly changed.

-

Hover Cell Area – Mr. Mime and Cramorant

Mime leans toward Cramorant, whispering slyly.
“Ceruledge and Armarouge? Pathetic. Starving for pity. Let them rot.”

Cramorant glares back blankly, before spitting water into Mime’s face.
“I want food,” he croaks bluntly.

Unfazed, Mime levitates untouched food trays meant for the bandit brothers. They hover toward Cramorant like treasure chests. He devours them noisily. Mime smirks.

“I’ve got bigger plans. Darkrai's gone—good riddance. Tyranitar? Might be useful... if I finish the Manifest Key first.”
A loud ZZZAP cuts him off mid-sentence as a spark lashes from the cell's edge. Mime flinches, electrocuted again in comical fashion. Cram snorts a laugh, still chewing.

-

Mime’s Secret Unfolds

Mime has been planning. Deeply. Secretly.

He whispers cruelly about Cinderace’s “pathetic” death, and unveils his secret tools:

- Cinderbot, a robot duplicate built with full Pyro Ball and Blaze Kick capabilities.

- Mimebot, a silent mimic equipped with stealth tech and psychic shielding.

“I waited. The guard's weak. And I’ve already checked your name, Cram. You're on the list now.” Mime grins. “Help me… and I feed you forever.”

-

Night of the Breakout

Late one night, General Officer Machamp snores at his post.

Mimebot quietly deploys a voice-dampening cube, muting all sound within a 10-meter radius. No noise escapes. Cinderbot melts through the glass of the hover cell with a focused heat kick.

Mime floats across his platform without a sound, quickly boxing Cramorant’s head to silence his reflex squawks. The two inmates slip out, undetected. They flee into the abyss.

-

Return to the Lab

They arrive at Mime’s old laboratory—buried beneath rubble and dust from the old Darkspin Studios collapse. Broken screens flicker faintly, and schematics cover the cracked floor.

A terminal boots up.
On it: a list.
Two names checked off—Mime and Cinderace.
Next: Cramorant.
And below that… more names. Ominous. Unspoken. Unseen.

Mime turns toward his new sidekick.
“Let’s rebuild the future. With bots that never fail.”

Cramorant gurgles a response, already eyeing the snack bar nearby.
The lab hums to life.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------



At the Lab
Mime turned to Cramorant and said calmly, “This will sting a little.” He fired a blueprint-DNA dart into Cram, extracting every trace of his DNA and innate power. The dart gently released, and Mime carefully loaded the data into one of his old, dusty auto-bot builders—of which several lined the lab, though only two had been activated so far: one using Mime’s DNA, and one using Cinderace’s.

As the machine whirred to life, processing Cram’s data, Mime casually began explaining how he obtained Cinderace’s DNA not long before the rabbit’s death.

-

Flashback – One Year Ago
It was a sunny day, still before the climax that would later ruin Tyranitar’s manor. Mime had escaped the estate undetected and wandered deep into a forgotten stretch of the sewers. There, hidden in darkness, he discovered an ominous list—a blueprint catalog of optimal DNA matches for future combat bots.

The first name on the list: Coach Cinderace.

Mime didn’t waste time. Still that very day—coincidentally, just before nightfall when Cramorant would go berserk—Mime traveled to the football stadium. Cinderace was mid-game, showing off for the crowd while his then-girlfriend, Lopunny, cheered from the stands.

Seizing the moment, Mime caught the football mid-air with his psychic powers. As Cinderace jogged up, irritated, Mime issued a quiet threat: he wouldn’t return the ball unless he could copy the rabbit’s DNA.

Cinderace reluctantly agreed—but not without lashing out. “You freak! Hope Darkrai tears you apart and paints the walls in your blood! Not even Ho-Oh could revive your twisted little head!” he spat.

Mime just smiled politely. “Your words may bite you in the back someday,” he said, then floated away.

Unseen in the crowd, an innocent Cramorant—still mentally stable—watched the encounter, head tilted in confusion. Mime, meanwhile, secretly hoped Darkrai would die, removing the last wild card from his long game.

-

Back to the Present
With a hiss and a flash of blue light, the Cramorant bot powered up. It resembled the original perfectly—complete with its gaping beak and unpredictable swallowing behavior—but with one major upgrade: its Water Pulse blast packed enough force to punch a hole straight through the lab wall on its first test.

Cramorant twitched, drooled, and tilted his head with a lopsided grin.
“Food buddy?” he asked, barely blinking.

Mime smirked. “Soon enough.”


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


Soon, the bot had a name: Crambot.
A perfect mimic of Cramorant in appearance—but enhanced, refined, and dangerous. Its Water Pulse now tore through walls like paper. Mime grinned at the satisfying hum of the machine, his collection growing.

-

The Next Day – CottonCheer Boutique
CottonCheer had quietly blossomed over the past four months—a cozy tailor shop nestled on the sunny edge of town, owned and run by none other than Eldegoss, the elegant cotton puff and local fashion icon. Known for her all-weather clothing and floral-themed accessories, she had recently become the personal stylist of Vaporeon, who arrived that day humming a tune and twirling in excitement.

“I’ll take this cheerleader outfit for me… and that quarterback jersey for my Flareon,” Vaporeon beamed, picturing the fire-type’s reaction. She skipped out the door, swaying her tail happily, only to pause when she noticed Chandelure hovering by the window display.

“I’d like to try something on too,” Chandelure chimed softly, a rare sparkle of curiosity in her ghostly glow.

Eldegoss gave a warm but apologetic smile. “I’m so sorry, dear. I haven’t finished designing outfits for your… unique frame yet. I promise you’re on my list!”

Chandelure floated off silently, disappointed—her ghost flames dimmed. As fate would have it, she drifted near a shadowed alley, unknowingly brushing past a concealed figure.

Mr. Mime, hidden behind a stack of boxes, flinched as one of Chandelure’s wandering flames grazed his hair, leaving a faint scorch. He growled under his breath. So close…

But he wasn’t deterred. Today’s mission was still a success waiting to happen.

Mime summoned Crambot, cloaked in stealth mode nearby. With surgical precision, the bot launched a soft DNA-collecting dart toward Eldegoss, striking her gently in the cotton fluff of her head as she stood at the storefront beside Vaporeon.

A flicker of dizziness washed over Eldegoss. “Hmm… must’ve stood up too fast,” she murmured, brushing it off with a laugh.

Vaporeon didn’t notice. She couldn’t—Mime had already psychically veiled the dart’s path from her vision, casting an illusion so smooth she didn’t blink.

Mime, invisible to both, calmly levitated the dart back to his coat pocket, smiling with satisfaction. Another name checked off the list.

As the two ladies chatted, the real Cramorant waddled nearby and swallowed a Vespiquen whole—the prize fished out lazily by Mime using a floating berry as bait. Mime rewarded him with a slow nod. "Good boy."

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------



The Next Targets: Two Icy Birds with One Dart

Mime didn’t rest. Momentum was everything now.

His next stop: the frosty, peaceful home of Mamoswine and his wife, Alolan Ninetales—a cozy hilltop cottage with a garden of snowberries and a windchime that never melted.

The couple were notoriously low-profile, rarely leaving their home, making them ideal targets. But Mime knew one flaw he could exploit: Ninetales’ clumsiness.

From a distance, Mime observed through a shimmer veil, as Ninetales twirled playfully in a light blue sundress, giggling while setting lunch outside on a patio table. Mamoswine was grunting happily, bringing over a tray of berry dumplings.

That’s when Mime made his move.

Using a flicker of invisible tech under her paws, he tripped Ninetales just as she stepped over the picnic cloth.

CRASH. The entire table went flying—plates, dumplings, tea kettle, everything.

“Oopsie—!!” Ninetales yelped as she tumbled into a half-somersault, a blur of white fluff and fabric.

Mamoswine’s eyes widened. “Honey?! Are you alright?!”

He rushed to help her up, completely distracted by the mess. Ninetales was giggling through her daze. “I’m okay! Just dizzy… maybe extra dizzy?”

Perfect.

From behind a frozen bush, Mime smirked and flicked his fingers. Two DNA darts zipped forward silently—one lodged into Mamoswine’s thick hide, and the other nestled neatly into Ninetales’ flowing mane.

A second later, they vanished back to Mime’s coat pocket, mission complete before the couple even realized they were targeted.

Mime didn’t linger. He slipped back down the hill where Cramorant was crunching down on some icicles… and half a landscaping rock.

“Two icy Pokémon,” Mime mused aloud, watching Cram drool proudly, “with one stone.”

Cram paused, blinked at him, and mumbled, “Stone tasty.”

Mime patted him on the beak. “You’re even dumber than your bot. I like that.”



--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------



Next Target: The Fallen Flame

Talonflame had once been a proud ace of the skies, a battle-hardened aerialist with a knack for risk and glory. But after a harsh financial collapse and a near-successful suicide dive off Mount Solace, he found unexpected salvation: Ho-Oh.

Now, Talonflame served as Ho-Oh’s assistant and watchman, a second chance he took seriously—perhaps too seriously. He’d taken up foraging as a mindful hobby, searching wild berry groves atop windy hills, savoring the peace he once tried to flee.

But Mime had his name on the list.

And Talonflame’s instincts were sharp—too sharp for a clean sneak attack.

So Mime devised something dumber.

He turned to his hungry bird partner. “Cram,” he whispered, “go call him a fried chicken.”

Cramorant blinked, twitched… then waddled straight out into the open.

“Hey! You! Roast turkey with wings! I’ll eat your feathers and still be hungry!”

Talonflame froze mid-peck, eyes twitching.

“…You what?!”

With a screech of rage, Talonflame exploded into the air, blazing like a rocket. “YOU WANNA FRY?! I’LL SHOW YOU KAMIKAZE!!”

He dove full-speed at Cramorant, who barely ducked in time.

CRACK—! Talonflame’s head slammed into a sturdy tree trunk, beak-first, and lodged into the bark with a sickening thunk.

Dazed. Stuck. Breathing ragged.

Mime didn’t waste a moment. He swooped in from the brush, and with a flick of a wrist, lodged a DNA dart under the flaming bird’s wing. Then he tapped his temple and poured psychic energy into Talonflame’s brain like bleach down a drain—scrubbing the last five minutes from memory.

But it came at a cost. Moderate strain, enough to make Mime stagger as he retreated.

Cramorant waddled alongside him, giggling. “Birdie bonked tree.”

Mime frowned. “That almost went too far.”

Back at the tree, Talonflame’s body trembled—he was suffocating. His wings flapped weakly as he gasped.

“…Ho… Ho-Oh…”

A golden feather shimmered overhead.

Within seconds, Ho-Oh descended in blinding light, eyes wide with panic. “Talon?!”

But it was too late.

Talonflame’s last breath escaped before the legendary could reach him. His flame extinguished.

Ho-Oh knelt, then closed his eyes—revival light engulfed the body, breathing life back into the watchman once more.

Moments later, Talonflame opened his eyes.

“…Wh-what happened?”

Ho-Oh looked around. “You were dying. Do you remember what struck you?”

Talon blinked slowly. “I… I was foraging. Then… I don’t know. It’s blank.”

From behind the bush, Mime and Cramorant sat crouched, watching in dead silence.

Mime whispered, still panting. “…That… was almost bad.”

Cramorant drooled. “Friend chicken came back.”

Mime wiped sweat off his face. “Next time, less lethal. I don’t need Ho-Oh sniffing us out.”



--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------



Back at the Lab

Four new figures lined the shadowy workbench—Eldebot, Ninetalebot, Mamobot, and Talonbot—each bearing the signature traits of their organic counterparts. Eldebot’s cotton spun like reactive armor. Ninetalebot's tails flicked with chilling grace. Mamobot’s tusks gleamed with reinforced metal. Talonbot's wings pulsed with overheating thrusters, now tamed to follow orders.

Mime’s fingers twitched in satisfaction. “Four down. Too many more to go.”

He turned to Cramorant, who was currently trying to swallow an empty soup can.

Mime sighed. “Let’s move.”

-

Next Targets: Blissey and Snorlax

The location: Umbreon’s private hospital, a facility known for its unshakable neutrality and tight psychic security. Most feared breaching it—Mean Look traps, aura scans, Umbreon’s eternal insomnia.

Mime feared none of it. He feared only sloppiness.

He knew Umbreon had a habit of sleeping only two hours every third day. That was today.

Mime arrived during visitor hours—invisible, odorless, and unnervingly calm.

Inside, Blissey cheerfully bustled through the halls with patient trays. Snorlax, recently reformed from his greedy years, now proudly served as the hospital chef, ladling stew into trays with sleepy grace. He hummed while he worked, occasionally snacking, occasionally nodding off mid-scoop.

Mime watched from a hidden vent above. With careful aim, he telekinetically embedded the DNA darts under the plastic lids of two lunch trays. One bound for Blissey’s hands. One for Snorlax’s personal snack.

Thunk.
Thunk.

Two soft injections—barely noticeable. Blissey winced slightly, but remained focused on delivery. Snorlax yawned and ate his.

Meanwhile, outside the hospital…

A nearby trash bin rocked violently. From inside, Cramorant poked his head out—drooling and very full.

He had eaten something.

Mime, now returned to the bin in invisible form, materialized with a rustle of wrappers.

He retrieved both darts—intact and glowing faintly with bio-data.

Then he paused.

His nose twitched.

“…Cram. Did you…?”

Cramorant tilted his head, utterly innocent—then pooped in the bin again.

Mime stared in cold silence. “You absolute seagull-brained—stop eating hospital leftovers. That’s not pudding!”

He levitated both darts, gagging quietly, and began to clean them with the same cloth he used to wipe Cram’s mouth.

Cram just drooled and chirped. “More food buddy?”

Mime shoved the lid back over the bin. “Not now. Next batch’s gonna be harder.”


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------



Next Targets: Greedent and Crustle

These two weren’t just any targets—they were trolls. And not just any trolls. Greedent, now loudmouthed and proudly vulgar, and Crustle, slightly more chill these days, but still prone to passive-aggressive jabs. Ever since Tyranitar cut them loose, the two had downgraded to being delivery boys—not by choice, but because no one else would take them.

One fine afternoon, Greedent was in Flareon's yard, yelling at him.

“Your food’s too spicy, furball! You try eatin' with scorched taste buds!”

Flareon, who had just finished prepping his fire-grilled berry kabobs, shot him a glare. “And maybe you shouldn’t be snacking on deliveries, you walking trash bin!”

Crustle, standing awkwardly behind the scene, mumbled under his breath, “You used to cook my relatives…”

Greedent cackled. “What, you mean the crabs? Hah!”

Without another word, Flareon shot a tiny flamethrower straight at Greedent’s rear.

“YEOWCH!”

Greedent bolted into a mad dash, running in circles across the yard, his fluffy tail dropping half-digested blue berries like confetti. Crustle calmly picked them up, one by one.

In the bushes nearby, three shadows lurked: Mime, Cramorant, and Crambot.

Mime sniffed the air. “Perfect. Fire, noise, distraction…”

He turned to the real Cram. “Break the sprinkler system.”

Cram nodded in full derp mode and launched a Water Gun at the fuse box.

The sprinklers burst to life—Greedent screamed in glee, trying to plant his burnt butt onto one of them while hopping like a panicked Psyduck. Crustle continued collecting dropped berries like nothing was wrong.

Now.

Mime released two invisible DNA darts, one for each of them. They struck clean—Crustle didn’t even flinch, and Greedent just thought it was a mosquito.

Mission complete. Mime retrieved the darts with psychic precision… albeit a bit damp from the sprinklers.

Cram, now sniffing around Flareon’s BBQ, turned to Mime and asked with his usual innocent voice:
“Can I eat the food? …Can I eat Flareon?”

Mime paused, glanced at Flareon—and whispered, “No. His mother is Espeon. She’ll call the authorities… and worse, she's useful later.”

Flareon, now steaming with rage, screamed:
“Get out of my yard, you filthy pests!!”

Greedent, ever defiant, slapped a soggy berry right into Flareon’s face.

FWOOSH.

Greedent’s whole face caught fire again—comically charred as he ran off into the horizon yelling “Worth it!”

Crustle attempted to sneak a kabob into his shell.
Flareon growled, “Crustle, no!”

Crustle froze… and then slowly tucked himself into his shell like nothing happened.

-

Back at the Lab

Four new bots stood in charging docks:

- Snorlaxbot – a silent, unmoving wall of steel belly.

- Blisseybot – constantly radiating weak healing mist, but too fragile for field work.

- Greedentbot – mischievous, with a food radar, but constantly asking for snacks.

- Crustlebot – heavy, armored, but secretly trying to hoard spare screws.

Mime marked the wall: 11 out of 30 bots done, including himself.

He sighed.

“The next batch won’t be this easy…”


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------



Next Targets: Pikachu and Absol

These two weren’t just players in the scene—they were nerds now, devout fans of the indie hit Mystic Vale Chronicles: Spirit of Galar, a game with such oddly deep mechanics and unpredictable micro-events that it built a cult following overnight. And these two? Top leaderboard climbers. But they weren’t just gaming buddies—they were housemates now, both living and working under the icy roof of Glaceon’s manor, alongside Leafeon (her mellow husband) and Vaporeon (her cheerful daughter).

Today, though, luck was on Mime’s side: the Eeveelutions were out.

Inside the quiet, frost-chilled manor, Pikachu was lounging on a beanbag, shooting texts to his girlfriend Alolan Raichu on one screen and min-maxing his character build on another. Across from him, Absol sat on a mossy rug near the window, tending to a pot of digital berry trees while simultaneously tweaking their in-game PvP stats.

Mime, hiding nearby, observed with a serious face.

“These two are trickier… Pikachu remembers me as a cringe gacha clown, sure… but he remembers Cramorant as a predatory trauma core monster. That memory? Still branded deep.”

He turned to Cram, holding out a bucket of fresh Vesula fish like he was bribing a hungry toddler.

“You’re sitting this one out. If Pikachu sees you, he’ll scream like a horror game streamer.”

Cramorant, already drooling, nodded and waddled toward the bucket in dumb happiness. Crisis averted.

Mime slipped into the manor through the side window, cold biting his metallic gloves. He winced.

“Jeez. No wonder Glaceon never sweats. It’s like a fridge in here…”

He crouched behind a sofa, watching Pikachu and Absol glued to their phones.

He grumbled quietly.

“How does this game make this much money? I made gacha once. Nobody wanted ‘Shiny Mime with Top Hat Variant #14’...”

But there was no time to sulk.

Mime raised his hand and snapped his fingers.

Reality twisted.

Absol’s phone screen morphed into a tabloid Poké-news page. Headlines of “Porkyman Scandals” scrolled wildly.

Absol groaned. “Bro, what happened to my Vale patch notes—?”

Meanwhile, Pikachu’s phone screen didn’t change to anything newsy—it changed into the last thing he ever wanted to see.

A high-res close-up image of Cramorant, mouth wide open.

Pikachu froze. His eyes widened. His ears twitched. The 1 year old trauma hit him like a truck.

He fainted. Instantly.

Absol’s eyes bugged out. “Wait—Pika?! Bro! Wake up!!”

Mime smirked. Now. With the two distracted, he released two cloaked DNA darts, one into each of them. Silent. Clean. Precise.

He snatched the darts back psychically, leapt out the window with catlike grace, and vanished before Absol could even detect the shift in air pressure.

Back in the shadows, Mime reported to Cramorant:

“Turns out your trauma-inducing crimes have long-term strategic value.”

Cram, now covered in Vesula guts and chewing on a melted popsicle stick, blinked slowly.

Absol, inside, eventually shook Pikachu awake. Pikachu blinked, eyes twitching.

“…Was it real…?”

“Nah man. I think the servers just glitched hard.”

Both of them quietly returned to Mystic Vale Chronicles as if nothing happened… but somewhere in the background, another set of names had just been checked off.


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Next Target: Slowbro

Recovering from past trauma and long shifts as a lifeguard, Slowbro had mellowed out considerably. These days, he just sat by the riverbank, basking under the sun, whispering “bruh” every few minutes like it was a spiritual mantra.

But there was a complication. A sentient, unsettling complication.

He’d somehow become the object of affection for Mimikyu, now a daycare owner with a tragic romantic streak. Her feelings were real. But Slowbro? He barely understood what day it was.

Which made him easy to dart—but hard to approach.

-

The River Plan

“Stick to the shadows,” Mime muttered as he adjusted his scuba gear, slipping into the cold water with precision.

Above the surface, Slowbro was sitting on a stone by the river like a cartoon fisherman without a rod, waiting for some poor soul to slip into the water so he could "save the day."

“C’mon… someone fall already... bruh...” he mumbled, bored and low-energy.

Below the water, Cramorant swam like a silent, mindless shark, sniping fish left and right with eerie calm. He seemed born for this.

Mime carefully aligned the cloaked DNA dart. One shot. It sunk into Slowbro’s back with a quiet phfht. A second later, the dart floated back into Mime’s hand.

Mission: clean.

Slowbro flinched lightly and rubbed his shoulder.

“…bruh.”

Then it happened.

Mimikyu emerged from a shadow.

Her aura was intense. Her disguise more tattered than usual. In her stitched hands, she offered a small box of chocolate.

“Slowbro… I brought these… for you…”

Slowbro blinked.

“…free food? Yum.”

He grabbed a chocolate without hesitation.

Mime, still lurking underwater, froze. His brain screamed: Abort. Abort. That’s Mimikyu. This is beyond boss battle.

She sensed something.

Her gaze swept toward the river. Even Cramorant paused mid-bite underwater, staring up in anxiety.

Mime didn’t wait—he kicked hard, trying to silently escape downriver—only to slam face-first into another floating figure.

A new one.

“Yo,” said Psyduck, lazily blinking underwater with a straw hat and floaties on. “You know which way the nearest bucket shop is?”

Mime blinked, utterly caught off guard. “…Ask Slowbro,” he muttered.

“Cool,” Psyduck replied, swimming up.

Above, Psyduck popped out near Slowbro and waved.

“Brooooooo! Long time no duck!”

Slowbro stared for a second. Then a dim light bulb sparked in his head.

“…Psyduck???”

A loud reunion moment burst into cheers and confused giggles. Mimikyu’s focus finally snapped—drawn into the heartwarming chaos.

Mime surfaced in silence, soaked and wide-eyed.

Cram was already ahead, swimming off with a soggy fish in his beak.

“New rule,” Mime muttered. “Never operate within 20 meters of a lovesick Mimikyu again.”

And just like that, they vanished into the reeds.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Next Target: Sylveon
—The Transwoman Teacher, Hero of the Darkrai Crisis—

Out of sheer twisted respect, Mime didn’t dare go lethal. Not after what Sylveon helped accomplish during the Tyranitar vs. Darkrai climax. Without her rallying Tyranitar into clashing Darkrai, Darkrai’s plan might’ve actually succeeded.

Mime grumbled under his breath. “Gratitude… doesn’t mean exemption.”

Her DNA was still on the list.

-

The Scene: Poketopia High, Late Afternoon

Classes were done. The air still buzzed with post-game energy. Sylveon stood near the couples-only locker room, elegantly chatting with Dragalok, the awkward yet polite son of Dragapult. They were discussing school funding cuts and potential bake sales—nothing unusual for a dedicated educator like her.

Nearby?

Inside the locker room:
Vaporeon, dressed in her cheerleader uniform with a proud pleated skirt, bridal-carried her boyfriend Flareon, who was nursing a minor injury from the school football game. Flareon’s quarterback gear was half-off, helmet removed, long leggings scuffed, but his ego still intact.

Sylveon chuckled as she watched the adorable couple vanish into their space. She found it sweet. And Mime?

Mime found it convenient.

-

The Plan: Distraction Over Damage

This time, Mime would avoid another “Talonflame Incident.” No death. Just chaos enough to shift attention.

Cloaked and hidden in the shadow of a nearby janitor’s closet, he muttered to Cramorant:

“Execute Flood Protocol. Blame Gyarados.”

Cramorant, without hesitation, unleashed Surf, crashing water into the hallway. Mime dropped pre-marked buckets near the windows—each with “Gyarados was here” scribbled on them in dripping Sharpedo ink.

The hallway flooded fast.

From within the locker room, Vaporeon noticed immediately. Like instinct, she didn’t panic—just lifted Flareon bridal-style, water sloshing around her ankles, and gracefully sprinted out into the corridor, her pleated skirt fluttering dramatically like a movie scene.

“Not again…” she muttered.

Sylveon turned in alarm at the commotion—and that’s when it happened.

From the slightly ajar storage room door, Mime launched a single cloaked DNA dart, hitting Sylveon with a pinpoint strike just as Dragalok panicked and flew off in confusion.

Sylveon blinked, dazed.

Mime caught the returning dart cleanly and slinked back into shadow.

-

“Good girl,” Mime whispered to himself. “Your school spirit served us well.”

Cramorant flapped by, soaking wet but smug. Mission complete.

-

Later, Outside the Locker Room

Vaporeon laid Flareon down onto a nearby bench, dripping wet but giggling together.

She glanced at the bucket trail.

“Ugh. Gyarados again? Seriously?”

Flareon shrugged and leaned back.

“Let karma handle it. Maybe Crustle will wall him next time.”

Vaporeon laughed, wiping his cheek with her cheer towel.

-

Back in the Lab

Four new bots emerged from the factory line:

- Absolbot

- Pikabot

- Slowbot

- Sylveonbot

Mime checked the list.
15 out of 30 targets complete.

Halfway there.

He smiled, but it wasn’t joy.

It was obsession.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


One Day at the Poketopia Inmate Facility…

Gardevoir stepped into the cold corridor of the underground detention unit. The air felt… wrong.

She came only to check on the remaining inmates—those involved in the Darkrai Crisis. But the silence? Not a good sign.

Then she saw it.

Ceruledge, motionless—collapsed in a pool of void-black blood, his own blade driven into himself with lethal precision. A bloodstained note lay beside him:

| “No Ho-Oh revive. We are done with life and its bullshit.”

Across the hallway, Armarouge—gone too. His body charred and fragmented, a bomb wired to his chest had already done the damage. No one heard it. No one came in time.

Only Buzzwole remained, chained and blankly staring at the wall, emotionally numb. Silent.

Gardevoir froze. Her pulse spiked. As a psychic, she sensed what happened before her eyes could fully register the scene. Her knees buckled slightly.

Then came Machamp, stepping into the hall, fists unclenched, expression ashamed.
Lucario followed—completely silent. He could feel her sorrow, but had no words.

And finally, Metagross levitated into the room, tone purely mechanical:

| “The city remains peaceful. However, the two escapees—Mime and Cramorant—remain unaccounted for. We are expanding patrol routes.”

Gardevoir’s fists clenched.

-

Meanwhile, in Mime’s Lab…

Mime quietly monitored the scene via a hacked prison drone, unbothered. Watching Gardevoir’s heartbreak unfold, he murmured:

| “Such powerful emotions… the three of them—Machamp, Lucario, Gardevoir—they’ll all be useful soon. Very useful.”

His plan advanced. There was no turning back.

-

That Night: Inteleon’s Bar — “The Siren Lounge”

Mime had left a note earlier, disguised as a marketing pitch, for Bartender Inteleon:

| “If her real self comes, your profits will double.”

Inteleon raised a brow but played along. He made the call.

The next day, Wigglytuff arrived from far away. She hadn’t sung in years, but the moment she hit the mic, the bar exploded with life.

Incineroar, Meowscarada, Dragonite, and many others filled the club to hear her voice.

Mime, cloaked and seated behind the radio booth, watched from the shadows.

Wigglytuff's final song finished, and someone from the audience raised a question:

| “What happened with you and Darkrai?”

The crowd fell quiet.

Wigglytuff took a breath, then shared the flashback:

-

Flashback:

Back in media school, she and Darkrai were dreamers—literally. He wrote melodies. She composed lyrics.

But it crumbled fast.

Darkrai fell into debt. Got obsessed with crypto scams, MLMs, shady influencers.

He begged for money, manipulating her kindness until she exposed him to the school board.

They expelled him.

He didn’t resist. Just said:

| “I won’t stop until I’m dead.”

And disappeared into the shadows.

-

Back to Present:

The audience sat in stunned silence.

And that’s when it happened.

From behind the club’s broadcast radio booth, Mime launched a cloaked dart. A direct hit.

Wigglytuff didn’t even flinch—not yet—too caught in the past.

Mime snatched the dart back and slipped out the fire escape just as Dragonite approached the stage to hug her.

Outside, Cramorant waited, chewing a Vesula fish.

| “That’s another one down,” Mime whispered. “Even Darkrai’s bad debts helped us. Funny how karma folds in on itself.”

15 targets completed.
16… now done.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


Next Targets: Zeraora and Garchomp
The list was past halfway, and Mime knew the next two weren’t fools.

Garchomp, a PE teacher with sharp instincts and a seismic temper.
Zeraora, fast, alert, and living under the same roof as Urshifu, the city’s walking martial law.

Failure meant not just capture, but dismantling—Urshifu didn’t tolerate second chances.

-

Early Morning, Urshifu’s Manor

Garchomp stepped out, stretching his arms and back. The air was cool, the school gym wasn’t far.

Mime, already cloaked and in position in a bush just beyond the manor’s trimmed yard, waited with the dart primed.

PFFT.

A direct hit—clean and fast. The DNA cartridge retracted.

Garchomp blinked. His spine tensed.
He looked around… nothing. Then muttered:

| “Huh… must’ve been some weird ground tremor. Earthquake numbness again…”

And jogged toward the school.

Mime whispered through his comms to Cram:

| “Phase one: success.”

Back at the Manor

Through a side window, Zeraora was sweeping his room with a broom. Focused. Calm. Earbuds in. A perfect opportunity.

Mime re-cloaked, scaled the outer wall silently, and fired.

PFFT. Dart in, DNA collected.

Zeraora scratched his shoulder absentmindedly.

| “Ugh, broom dust. This place never stays clean…”

Mime didn’t wait to celebrate. He vanished the second the cartridge retracted.

Cramorant, watching from the shadows, gave a silent nod and began waddling off with Mime through the forest trail behind the manor.

-

Seconds Later…

Urshifu walked into the hallway.

He froze.

His nostrils flared. His senses—battle-hardened—picked up something wrong. Someone had been here.

| “...Someone peeked,” he growled, narrowing his eyes at the open window.

The tension in the air shifted. Something had almost gone wrong.

But the intruders were already gone.

Back at the Lab – Midnight Glow, Hum of Machines

The cloning chamber hissed, steam releasing from the sealed pods as Mime watched with sharp anticipation. One by one, mechanical hands calibrated, aligned, and dropped the DNA cartridges into their respective sockets.

First Pod – Activation: Wigglybot
A soft jingle echoed as the bot’s eyes flickered to life, lined with glowing pastel light bars. Its microphone extended automatically, rigged with sonic emitters capable of both lullabies and soundwave disruption.

Mime adjusted her vocal pitch dial and muttered:

| “Not as emotional as the real one, but just as loud.”

Second Pod – Activation: Garchompbot
The chamber shook as the pod unlocked. Steel wings unfolded from its back, tipped with turbine boosters. Its claws gleamed with reinforced alloy plating, ground-cracking drills tucked beneath each forearm.

Cram peeked nervously from behind a console.

| “Careful with that one,” Mime muttered. “One glitch and we lose the entire east wing.”

Third Pod – Activation: Zerabot
There was no hiss this time—just a flicker, then a snap of electricity as the pod burst open in a flash of neon blue. The bot stood already crouched, scanning the room in bursts of data pulses, eyes shaped like jagged lightning bolts.

| “Built for speed and subterfuge,” Mime noted with a smirk. “And no broom required.”

He slid the cartridges into the storage vault, sealing them with biometric lock.

Three new additions. Now 18 out of 30.
The control board’s counter updated, glowing red and ominous.

Mime leaned back against the console.

| “Almost there. But we need to lay low… Urshifu’s nose is getting close.”

Cramorant nodded while munching a leftover berry, unaware it was actually one of Flareon’s emergency rations.

Next Target: Gengar
Gengar, now a frequent guest around Galarian Rapidash’s manor, had become a local celebrity as the charismatic event host of Mystic Vale Chronicles: Spirit of Galar. He held deep respect for Rapidash—after all, she was the very one who orchestrated Tyranitar’s final clash with Darkrai, effectively ending that nightmare. Mime knew this respect made Gengar extra cautious around her, so separating him from her watchful gaze would be the only way to succeed.

Unfortunately, it wouldn’t just be Gengar he’d have to deal with—Sableye, his ever-grinning prankster sidekick, would tag along too. Mime hated that. Sableye’s uncanny ability to pop up anywhere made him one of the most annoying roadblocks to a clean extraction.

That afternoon, Tsareena—recently done with her part designing event art for the game—returned to her garden, leaving Gengar unattended for now. Mime, hiding in the shadows, mumbled, “One obstacle down.”

He activated an old-fashioned radio and cranked the volume. A booming voice echoed: “CALLING ALL SPOOKY HOSTS—A LIMITED GHOST-TYPE-ONLY EVENT AWAITS. LEGENDARY HAUNTING OPPORTUNITIES!” The sound was obnoxiously fake, but baited just right.

Rapidash, hearing it, called out firmly, “Gengar, Sableye—check it out. Now.”

The two ghosts saluted, half-serious. “Yes ma’am!”

They zipped off toward the source of the sound, floating just a little too gleefully. But Mime was already waiting. From a distance, he flipped the channel on the radio, replacing the voice with an unholy fusion of sketchy-sounding Porkyman ads and overly suggestive commentary.

Both ghosts screeched in comedic disgust.

“Dude, what the hell is this!?” Gengar cringed.

“It’s got cringe energy, bro!” Sableye cackled.

Their laughter shook the treetops. Right then, Mime made his move—a cloaked, perfect shot, straight into Gengar’s back. The ghost didn’t even flinch, too busy gag-laughing.

“Target acquired,” Mime whispered into his comms.

Cramorant, lurking nearby, got the next order. With surgical comedic timing, he shot the radio clean through. The blast exploded into a burst of static and smoke, launching both ghosts into the air like cartoon cannonballs. They crashed into nearby hedges but still cheered the slapstick impact.

Mime exhaled with relief. “That damn Sableye… One second later and we would've been jump-scared into orbit.”

They vanished into the forest, successful once again.

Back at the Lab – A New Haunting Begins
The lab’s security shutters slammed shut as the containment pod hissed open. Inside: a sleek, floating machine cloaked in unstable shadow energy. Its teeth were metallic, oversized, and always grinning. Sensors flickered inside its eyes—no longer playful, now cold and calculating.

Gengarbot had awakened.

It phased through the pod’s wall without opening the door, startling even Cram. It left no footprints—only distortion in the air behind it. It didn’t laugh. It didn’t smile. But it stared directly at the lab's camera, as if it already knew what came next.

Mime clapped once, satisfied.
“Spookier than the real thing. And deadlier.”
