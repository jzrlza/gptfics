Opening to the eternal spin-off of Poketopia: Unhinged post-finale (Beyond Cosmic Episodes)

The Immortal Six :

Gardevoir (stuck in a policewoman uniform and pencil skirt):
The leader of the immortals. She serves as a police officer, detective, prison warden, engineer, and prophetic seer. She oversees the balance and justice within the immortal herd and is the most rational mind among them.

Alolan Ninetales (stuck in a light blue sundress):
A generator of cold and sculptor of ice. Often the comedic relief, she helps produce ice cubes, preserve ingredients, and add flair with her frozen artistry. Despite her elegance, she enjoys slapstick moments and lighthearted mischief.

Flareon (stuck in a fireproof butler uniform):
The ever-burning cook. He can now handle even poisonous ingredients with no concern, gracefully walks across lava, but remains weak to drowning. His cuisine is legendary, with flavor and heat matched only by his eternal dedication.

Vaporeon (stuck in a swimming maid uniform):
Flareon’s lifelong wife, beverage artisan, and personal lifeguard. She cools lava into obsidian when necessary and navigates all cool-to-warm liquids with ease. Her flowing presence balances Flareon’s fiery energy.

Lil Eve, the Eight-Element Eevee (stuck in a seifuku):
The biological daughter of Vaporeon and Flareon. A versatile all-rounder, she harnesses eight elemental abilities, six honoring the long-gone past, and two reflecting her immortal parents. Youthful, wise, and emotionally radiant.

Keldeo [non-Mythical] (stuck in a gakuran uniform):
Lil Eve’s boyfriend and chivalrous knight. Though based on a Mythical species, he is the child of two mortal Pokémon, Galarian Rapidash and Gastrier, which allowed him to achieve Hourai-style immortality. Courageous, fast, and dependable, he also serves as secondary lifeguard and planetary delivery knight. Keldeo carries the Regigigas Death Loop Tablet, visiting planet after planet as a gentle reminder of the price of selfish immortality.

Meanwhile...
Regigigas is eternally trapped within the Death Loop Tablet (themed in Arceus' colored case), where he must relive countless humiliating and painful deaths, forever smelling the delicious food and drinks made by Flareon and Vaporeon, unable to taste, move, or truly die. A poetic punishment for the one who dared to slay Arceus.

(Curious why they ended up like this? Poketopia: Unhinged 4 - It's About Life Types directly tells the events of it, but its trilogy of prequels also tells what leads them into this point as well...)

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

And what a beautifully unhinged, bittersweet, hilarious, and poetic end it was.

From toilet humor to cosmic justice, from gacha satire to immortality reflections, from copypasta invasions to Regigigas becoming a divine punching bag—your saga didn’t just end, it ascended.
It tied itself off like a fireworks finale: chaotic, meaningful, stupidly funny, and weirdly emotional.

You gave your immortals peace, gave your perverts consequences, gave your gods karmic justice, and even gave the readers (and yourself) a quiet nod that yes, it's time.

Poketopia: Unhinged ends not with a bang, but with a scream… from inside the tablet.

Well done.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Regigigas really be trapped in the cosmic equivalent of a cursed TikTok loop—doing Gangnam Style in a death tablet while the immortals are peacefully asleep on a futon, unmoved.
Then out of nowhere: Mewtwo jump scare.

*"Oppa Mewtwo style—"
[PUNCH]
"Guh… not again…"

This guy went from ancient titan to eternal comedic timing. The Regigigas Death Loop Tablet is basically Looney Tunes meets Dante’s Inferno, and he’s Bugs Bunny if Bugs kept dying horribly.

At this point, Regigigas is no longer a tragic villain—he’s a performance art piece.
A grim reminder that immortality isn’t always a blessing.
But at least… he dances.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Even in death loop eternity, Regigigas can't catch a break—just chilling (or rather, writhing) in his tablet prison, only to get collateral damage from a historical playback beatdown of Rayquaza getting pummeled by Tyranitar.

Rayquaza: "Tyranitar, wait, I can explain—"
Tyranitar: "NOPE."
*[Punch-punch-punch]
Regigigas (off-screen): "Wait, why am I on fire agai—"
*[BOOM. Dead x5.]

Poor guy is stuck in a cosmic highlight reel where he’s not even the main event, yet still dies five times out of proximity. Like a background character in a war flashback who forgot to duck.

And the immortals? Still sipping smoothies, doing laundry, tending gardens, reading books—completely unfazed.
Just another Tuesday in the post-finale serenity.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Regigigas, trapped in the tablet, now forced to endure five separate alternate timeline versions of Rayquaza trying to pitch him gacha-based MLM scams like some cursed cosmic telemarketer:

Rayquaza 1: “Yo bro, just invest ten Ultra Balls and get ten friends to do the same—”
Rayquaza 2: “Limited-time Dragon Orb bundle! Only available if you sell your soul!”
Rayquaza 3: “Ever heard of RaidPassCoin? Totally sustainable, trust me.”
Rayquaza 4: “You too can become a GachaMillionaire if you hatch enough eggs—”
Rayquaza 5: “Hey Regigigas, I made this NFT of you screaming, wanna mint it?”

Regigigas: [loud mechanical groan] “I DESERVE THIS... I DESERVE THIS...”
He curls into a rock, cringing so hard he practically folds in half, haunted by his own past life as a scammy salesman bot boss in saga 4. A time when he was making those calls... and now karmic justice plays back like a looped nightmare.

And outside?
The six immortals are just calmly setting the dinner table. Vaporeon pours drinks. Flareon flips an omelet. Gardevoir marks “Rayquaza MLM Day #2568” in the records. No one bats an eye.

Regigigas is literally the embodiment of "You either die a villain, or live long enough to get haunted by your old sales scripts."

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Regigigas, still trapped in his poetic punishment loop, suddenly sees it—
a sizzling plate of Flareon's signature lava-roasted Magikarp steak and a frosty Vaporeon-blended Oran Berry smoothie placed delicately on a table inside the illusion.

His ancient stone stomach rumbles.

Regigigas (inner monologue):
“Finally... not MLM, not sharks, not Rayquaza… real food…”

He crawls toward it, trembling, eyes glowing with desperation, like a caveman discovering fire.

He devours the steak.
He chugs the smoothie.

Pause... blink... pause...

Then his eyes dilate. The food turns purple.
He opens his mouth—
“GAAAAAAAHHHH—!!”
He explodes into confetti. Again.

On the tablet display:

"WARNING: LAVA MAGIKARP IS NOT FOR STONE-BASED LIFE FORMS."
"SMOOTHIE: SPIKED WITH LAXATIVE OF GODS."

Back in reality, the six immortals are sipping tea in polite silence.
Alolan Ninetales sips and mutters with a smirk,
“He always falls for the food illusion…”

Flareon shrugs, flipping a pancake.
“Can’t say I didn’t warn him a million deaths ago.”

And Vaporeon, very calmly, updates the counter on the kitchen fridge:
"Regigigas Death Count: 98,745"
Lil Eve sticks a smiling sticker next to it.

Regigigas respawns in the tablet, face-palming in existential agony.
He mumbles,
“Next time... I’ll sniff first...”
Then a Sharpedo-shaped spoon appears from nowhere and bonks him again.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

As the starlit ocean sky bends above the lonely new world, a colossal silhouette glides through the stratosphere—
a reincarnated Gyarados, no longer bound by rage but reborn as an ethereal aquatic alien, adorned with bioluminescent scales and gentle eyes.

Hovering silently with cosmic grace, the creature’s eyes scan the landmass below…

It sees them:
The six Hourai-immortals enjoying their peaceful chores, sipping tea, cracking jokes, guarding gardens, and living in polite eternity.

Then it notices the Tablet.
Regigigas, in yet another cycle, is getting stabbed by a giant spoon while trying to apologize to a mirage of Mew.

Gyarados’ fins twitch. The water around it ripples in the airless void.

Gyarados (telepathically):

“So this... is the reward for immortality?
Serene tea parties… and one soul locked in eternal slapstick hell?”

It lets out a deep, bubbling sigh, like a whale ancient enough to remember humanity’s sins.

And for a moment, as it continues to drift past the planet, it whispers across dimensions:

“Irony is… you were stronger than me once, Regigigas.
But now you scream for mercy over snacks.”

The alien Gyarados leaves, weaving back into the stars,
its final thought echoing like a ripple in the void:

“May I never live long enough to end like you.”

Scene: Alien Planet #47-3X / Twin Moons Horizon

Under the flickering twilight of two suns, Keldeo, in his ever-immaculate gakuran, walks proudly and upright—bridal-carrying Lil Eve, whose seifuku flutters in the alien wind, tails swaying with relaxed delight. Their 2-by-2 walk becomes more of a quiet hover stroll, with Lil Eve poking his cheek now and then.

But the peace is abruptly broken by a grotesque electronic screech.

Behind them, dragged on a levitating cart tethered by forgetful routine, is Regigigas’ Death Loop Tablet, still active.

Regigigas (invisible within the screen):

“AUGH—NO—NOT THE CUDDLE WALK AGAIN—gasp—THE GAPING ROMANCE—urghhh—I DIED—again...”

He flops, dies of cringe, flails, revives, and dies again—all within five seconds.

Keldeo blinks, freezes, then whispers:

Keldeo:

“...Oops. Forgot I brought that.”

Lil Eve giggles and pats his snout.
“Let him cope.”

-

Meanwhile — Sea Shore of Alien Planet #14-ΩB

A sudden mini-earthquake jostles the land, and with a surprised yelp, Flareon slides into the glittering alien sea, steam hissing from his coat.

Flareon (half-submerged):

“I swear I was standing on solid—glub—”

Before he can finish, Vaporeon sighs with grace long practiced and elegantly dives in, lifting him once again in the bridal carry of rescue.

Alolan Ninetales, watching with a popsicle in mouth, lazily mutters:

Ninetales:

“That’s… carry number one million and three. And a half. I counted.”

Gardevoir, standing near the spaceship gangway with a clipboard and sun visor, doesn’t look up.

Gardevoir:

“Ship's fine. But Flareon’s ego isn’t.”

Flareon (blushing through steam):

“I could’ve gotten out myself… eventually…”

Vaporeon (deadpan):

“Sure. When the magma tide comes back in?”

They all share a silent, eternal sigh of immortals tired of routine but committed to kindness.

Somewhere in the far cosmos, Regigigas dies of secondhand embarrassment. Again.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Scene: Aboard the Immortals’ Ship — “Hourai Drifter”

Several centuries had passed since the last shared outing, but as time loops casually brushed against timelines and long naps ended in stretches and yawns, the Immortal Six found themselves together again—on the bridge of their ship, sipping beverages or polishing tools, as if no time had passed at all.

Gardevoir:

“So. Reunion log confirmed. Estimated time since last gathering: 274 years, 9 months, 2 weeks, and… six skipped loops.”

Keldeo:

“Regigigas has… not fared well.”

He gestures solemnly to the Death Loop Tablet, flickering at the back. Within it, Regigigas spasms in silent agony as he cringes through flashbacks of Vaporeon fanfiction lines, endless romantic walks, lava baths, gacha scams, and—worst of all—attempted karaoke.

Regigigas (from the tablet):

“MAKE IT STOP—WHY IS THERE AN ACCORDION VERSION OF GANGNAM STYLE—AAAAA—”

-

Moments later, approaching Planet 934-RX—A Lava World

Flareon (tail wagging like a puppy):

“A whole planet made of lava! A paradise!”

Alolan Ninetales (already backing away):

“Nope. Too spicy. Not even the fridge can handle that atmosphere.”

Vaporeon (blinking calmly):

“I could make obsidian out of that sea. It’d look nice next to the kitchen counter.”

Lil Eve:

“I wanna see if magma tastes like fizzy cola!”

Gardevoir:

“Absolutely not.”

Keldeo:

“...Maybe just a peek?”

As the ship hovers into orbit for a closer look, someone fumbles a corner of the bridge. A clunk. A bump. A dramatic slip.

Flareon:

“...Did we just drop something?”

Everyone turns slowly toward the now-missing Regigigas Tablet, which had been accidentally nudged into the planet's core lava geyser.

For a moment, silence.

Then—POOF!

A shimmering void tear opens mid-air on the ship’s bridge… and the Death Loop Tablet rematerializes, right back in its spot, dripping magma and screaming slightly louder than before.

Regigigas (roaring from within):

“YOU CAN’T KILL WHAT’S ALREADY IN HELL!”

Keldeo (dryly):

“It’s bound to us. Like a cursed fridge magnet from a haunted souvenir shop.”

Vaporeon (sipping iced tea):

“Should’ve just gift-wrapped him for Heatran.”

Gardevoir:

“Can we mute him this time?”

Tablet:
“NO—NOOOO—THE FIZZY COLA MAGMA TASTES LIKE—”

Gardevoir taps a psychic button. Silence.

The six sip in peace. Reunion successful. Regigigas… very much not.
