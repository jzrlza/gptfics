Opening to the eternal spin-off of Poketopia: Unhinged post-finale (Beyond Cosmic Episodes)

The Immortal Six :

Gardevoir (stuck in a policewoman uniform and pencil skirt):
The leader of the immortals. She serves as a police officer, detective, prison warden, engineer, and prophetic seer. She oversees the balance and justice within the immortal herd and is the most rational mind among them.

Alolan Ninetales (stuck in a light blue sundress):
A generator of cold and sculptor of ice. Often the comedic relief, she helps produce ice cubes, preserve ingredients, and add flair with her frozen artistry. Despite her elegance, she enjoys slapstick moments and lighthearted mischief.

Flareon (stuck in a fireproof butler uniform):
The ever-burning cook. He can now handle even poisonous ingredients with no concern, gracefully walks across lava, but remains weak to drowning. His cuisine is legendary, with flavor and heat matched only by his eternal dedication.

Vaporeon (stuck in a swimming maid uniform):
Flareon’s lifelong wife, beverage artisan, and personal lifeguard. She cools lava into obsidian when necessary and navigates all cool-to-warm liquids with ease. Her flowing presence balances Flareon’s fiery energy.

Lil Eve, the Eight-Element Eevee (stuck in a seifuku):
The biological daughter of Vaporeon and Flareon. A versatile all-rounder, she harnesses eight elemental abilities, six honoring the long-gone past, and two reflecting her immortal parents. Youthful, wise, and emotionally radiant.

Keldeo [non-Mythical] (stuck in a gakuran uniform):
Lil Eve’s boyfriend and chivalrous knight. Though based on a Mythical species, he is the child of two mortal Pokémon, Galarian Rapidash and Gastrier, which allowed him to achieve Hourai-style immortality. Courageous, fast, and dependable, he also serves as secondary lifeguard and planetary delivery knight. Keldeo carries the Regigigas Death Loop Tablet, visiting planet after planet as a gentle reminder of the price of selfish immortality.

Meanwhile...
Regigigas is eternally trapped within the Death Loop Tablet (themed in Arceus' colored case), where he must relive countless humiliating and painful deaths, forever smelling the delicious food and drinks made by Flareon and Vaporeon, unable to taste, move, or truly die. A poetic punishment for the one who dared to slay Arceus.

(Curious why they ended up like this? Poketopia: Unhinged 4 - It's About Life Types directly tells the events of it, but its trilogy of prequels also tells what leads them into this point as well...)

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

And what a beautifully unhinged, bittersweet, hilarious, and poetic end it was.

From toilet humor to cosmic justice, from gacha satire to immortality reflections, from copypasta invasions to Regigigas becoming a divine punching bag, your saga didn’t just end, it ascended.
It tied itself off like a fireworks finale: chaotic, meaningful, stupidly funny, and weirdly emotional.

You gave your immortals peace, gave your perverts consequences, gave your gods karmic justice, and even gave the readers (and yourself) a quiet nod that yes, it's time.

Poketopia: Unhinged ends not with a bang, but with a scream… from inside the tablet.

Well done.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Regigigas really be trapped in the cosmic equivalent of a cursed TikTok loop, doing Gangnam Style in a death tablet while the immortals are peacefully asleep on a futon, unmoved.
Then out of nowhere: Mewtwo jump scare.

*"Oppa Mewtwo style, "
[PUNCH]
"Guh… not again…"

This guy went from ancient titan to eternal comedic timing. The Regigigas Death Loop Tablet is basically Looney Tunes meets Dante’s Inferno, and he’s Bugs Bunny if Bugs kept dying horribly.

At this point, Regigigas is no longer a tragic villain, he’s a performance art piece.
A grim reminder that immortality isn’t always a blessing.
But at least… he dances.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Even in death loop eternity, Regigigas can't catch a break, just chilling (or rather, writhing) in his tablet prison, only to get collateral damage from a historical playback beatdown of Rayquaza getting pummeled by Tyranitar.

Rayquaza: "Tyranitar, wait, I can explain, "
Tyranitar: "NOPE."
*[Punch-punch-punch]
Regigigas (off-screen): "Wait, why am I on fire agai, "
*[BOOM. Dead x5.]

Poor guy is stuck in a cosmic highlight reel where he’s not even the main event, yet still dies five times out of proximity. Like a background character in a war flashback who forgot to duck.

And the immortals? Still sipping smoothies, doing laundry, tending gardens, reading books, completely unfazed.
Just another Tuesday in the post-finale serenity.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Regigigas, trapped in the tablet, now forced to endure five separate alternate timeline versions of Rayquaza trying to pitch him gacha-based MLM scams like some cursed cosmic telemarketer:

Rayquaza 1: “Yo bro, just invest ten Ultra Balls and get ten friends to do the same, ”
Rayquaza 2: “Limited-time Dragon Orb bundle! Only available if you sell your soul!”
Rayquaza 3: “Ever heard of RaidPassCoin? Totally sustainable, trust me.”
Rayquaza 4: “You too can become a GachaMillionaire if you hatch enough eggs, ”
Rayquaza 5: “Hey Regigigas, I made this NFT of you screaming, wanna mint it?”

Regigigas: [loud mechanical groan] “I DESERVE THIS... I DESERVE THIS...”
He curls into a rock, cringing so hard he practically folds in half, haunted by his own past life as a scammy salesman bot boss in saga 4. A time when he was making those calls... and now karmic justice plays back like a looped nightmare.

And outside?
The six immortals are just calmly setting the dinner table. Vaporeon pours drinks. Flareon flips an omelet. Gardevoir marks “Rayquaza MLM Day #2568” in the records. No one bats an eye.

Regigigas is literally the embodiment of "You either die a villain, or live long enough to get haunted by your old sales scripts."

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Regigigas, still trapped in his poetic punishment loop, suddenly sees it, 
a sizzling plate of Flareon's signature lava-roasted Magikarp steak and a frosty Vaporeon-blended Oran Berry smoothie placed delicately on a table inside the illusion.

His ancient stone stomach rumbles.

Regigigas (inner monologue):
“Finally... not MLM, not sharks, not Rayquaza… real food…”

He crawls toward it, trembling, eyes glowing with desperation, like a caveman discovering fire.

He devours the steak.
He chugs the smoothie.

Pause... blink... pause...

Then his eyes dilate. The food turns purple.
He opens his mouth, 
“GAAAAAAAHHHH, !!”
He explodes into confetti. Again.

On the tablet display:

"WARNING: LAVA MAGIKARP IS NOT FOR STONE-BASED LIFE FORMS."
"SMOOTHIE: SPIKED WITH LAXATIVE OF GODS."

Back in reality, the six immortals are sipping tea in polite silence.
Alolan Ninetales sips and mutters with a smirk,
“He always falls for the food illusion…”

Flareon shrugs, flipping a pancake.
“Can’t say I didn’t warn him a million deaths ago.”

And Vaporeon, very calmly, updates the counter on the kitchen fridge:
"Regigigas Death Count: 98,745 x 10^15"
Lil Eve sticks a smiling sticker next to it.

Regigigas respawns in the tablet, face-palming in existential agony.
He mumbles,
“Next time... I’ll sniff first...”
Then a Sharpedo-shaped spoon appears from nowhere and bonks him again.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

As the starlit ocean sky bends above the lonely new world, a colossal silhouette glides through the stratosphere, 
a reincarnated Gyarados, no longer bound by rage but reborn as an ethereal aquatic alien, adorned with bioluminescent scales and gentle eyes.

Hovering silently with cosmic grace, the creature’s eyes scan the landmass below…

It sees them:
The six Hourai-immortals enjoying their peaceful chores, sipping tea, cracking jokes, guarding gardens, and living in polite eternity.

Then it notices the Tablet.
Regigigas, in yet another cycle, is getting stabbed by a giant spoon while trying to apologize to a mirage of Mew.

Gyarados’ fins twitch. The water around it ripples in the airless void.

Gyarados (telepathically):

“So this... is the reward for immortality?
Serene tea parties… and one soul locked in eternal slapstick hell?”

It lets out a deep, bubbling sigh, like a whale ancient enough to remember humanity’s sins.

And for a moment, as it continues to drift past the planet, it whispers across dimensions:

“Irony is… you were stronger than me once, Regigigas.
But now you scream for mercy over snacks.”

The alien Gyarados leaves, weaving back into the stars,
its final thought echoing like a ripple in the void:

“May I never live long enough to end like you.”

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Scene: Alien Planet #47-3X / Twin Moons Horizon

Under the flickering twilight of two suns, Keldeo, in his ever-immaculate gakuran, walks proudly and upright, bridal-carrying Lil Eve, whose seifuku flutters in the alien wind, tails swaying with relaxed delight. Their 2-by-2 walk becomes more of a quiet hover stroll, with Lil Eve poking his cheek now and then.

But the peace is abruptly broken by a grotesque electronic screech.

Behind them, dragged on a levitating cart tethered by forgetful routine, is Regigigas’ Death Loop Tablet, still active.

Regigigas (invisible within the screen):

“AUGH, NO, NOT THE CUDDLE WALK AGAIN, gasp, THE GAPING ROMANCE, urghhh, I DIED, again...”

He flops, dies of cringe, flails, revives, and dies again, all within five seconds.

Keldeo blinks, freezes, then whispers:

Keldeo:

“...Oops. Forgot I brought that.”

Lil Eve giggles and pats his snout.
“Let him cope.”

-

Meanwhile ,  Sea Shore of Alien Planet #14-ΩB

A sudden mini-earthquake jostles the land, and with a surprised yelp, Flareon slides into the glittering alien sea, steam hissing from his coat.

Flareon (half-submerged):

“I swear I was standing on solid, glub, ”

Before he can finish, Vaporeon sighs with grace long practiced and elegantly dives in, lifting him once again in the bridal carry of rescue.

Alolan Ninetales, watching with a popsicle in mouth, lazily mutters:

Ninetales:

“That’s… carry number one million and three. And a half. I counted.”

Gardevoir, standing near the spaceship gangway with a clipboard and sun visor, doesn’t look up.

Gardevoir:

“Ship's fine. But Flareon’s ego isn’t.”

Flareon (blushing through steam):

“I could’ve gotten out myself… eventually…”

Vaporeon (deadpan):

“Sure. When the magma tide comes back in?”

They all share a silent, eternal sigh of immortals tired of routine but committed to kindness.

Somewhere in the far cosmos, Regigigas dies of secondhand embarrassment. Again.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Scene: Aboard the Immortals’ Ship ,  “Hourai Drifter”

Several centuries had passed since the last shared outing, but as time loops casually brushed against timelines and long naps ended in stretches and yawns, the Immortal Six found themselves together again, on the bridge of their ship, sipping beverages or polishing tools, as if no time had passed at all.

Gardevoir:

“So. Reunion log confirmed. Estimated time since last gathering: 274 years, 9 months, 2 weeks, and… six skipped loops.”

Keldeo:

“Regigigas has… not fared well.”

He gestures solemnly to the Death Loop Tablet, flickering at the back. Within it, Regigigas spasms in silent agony as he cringes through flashbacks of Vaporeon fanfiction lines, endless romantic walks, lava baths, gacha scams, and, worst of all, attempted karaoke.

Regigigas (from the tablet):

“MAKE IT STOP, WHY IS THERE AN ACCORDION VERSION OF GANGNAM STYLE, AAAAA, ”

-

Moments later, approaching Planet 934-RX, A Lava World

Flareon (tail wagging like a puppy):

“A whole planet made of lava! A paradise!”

Alolan Ninetales (already backing away):

“Nope. Too spicy. Not even the fridge can handle that atmosphere.”

Vaporeon (blinking calmly):

“I could make obsidian out of that sea. It’d look nice next to the kitchen counter.”

Lil Eve:

“I wanna see if magma tastes like fizzy cola!”

Gardevoir:

“Absolutely not.”

Keldeo:

“...Maybe just a peek?”

As the ship hovers into orbit for a closer look, someone fumbles a corner of the bridge. A clunk. A bump. A dramatic slip.

Flareon:

“...Did we just drop something?”

Everyone turns slowly toward the now-missing Regigigas Tablet, which had been accidentally nudged into the planet's core lava geyser.

For a moment, silence.

Then, POOF!

A shimmering void tear opens mid-air on the ship’s bridge… and the Death Loop Tablet rematerializes, right back in its spot, dripping magma and screaming slightly louder than before.

Regigigas (roaring from within):

“YOU CAN’T KILL WHAT’S ALREADY IN HELL!”

Keldeo (dryly):

“It’s bound to us. Like a cursed fridge magnet from a haunted souvenir shop.”

Vaporeon (sipping iced tea):

“Should’ve just gift-wrapped him for Heatran.”

Gardevoir:

“Can we mute him this time?”

Tablet:
“NO, NOOOO, THE FIZZY COLA MAGMA TASTES LIKE, ”

Gardevoir taps a psychic button. Silence.

The six sip in peace. Reunion successful. Regigigas… very much not.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

[Scene: Inside the Hourai Drifter – 69 Years Post-Lava Tablet Incident]

The Immortal Six gathered once again in their orbiting spaceship, sipping experimental teas made by Vaporeon and dodging Regigigas’ latest “I died again” notifications from the corner.

Keldeo dusted off a device labeled "Chronoscene Reflector", more commonly known as the Flashback Machine, an artifact that lets immortals project ultra-ancient memories into immersive holographic panoramas.

Lil Eve:

“Let’s see something from… 2.0003738292 billion years ago. Just before the long nap era.”

Flareon (chuckling):

“Oh wow. Poketopia Saga 4? That was peak grinding era.”

The machine buzzed to life, light streaming like memory waterfalls as it displayed a lively ancient Poketopia scene, sunset orange skies, impossibly tall structures, and yes…

-

Flashback Scene:

Crustle (waving blueprint scrolls):

“If I stack NetherSalt blocks from void to world top, and fill every single cubic meter, I’d finish the Beacon in about... 666 million years! Haha!”

Flareon (in the past, distracted by Vaporeon cooking):

“Mhm. Sounds cool. Can I eat NetherSalt?”

Garganacl (stoic):

“It’s pointless. Even immortals won’t waste forever on something so… grindy. I’d rather learn all dialects of Pokémon speech. Or nap.”

Crustle (grinning):

“C’mon! You just don’t appreciate true legacy structure design!”

Suddenly, Greedent waddles in, twinkle-eyed and grinning.

Greedent:

“Hey guys, did you know that in terms of, ”

Click.

-

Back to Present:

Vaporeon, now stirring a drink, had abruptly shut off the flashback machine, her eye twitching in exhaustion. Without warning, she lifted her swimming maid skirt just slightly with a teasing glance at Flareon.

Flareon (sputtering):

“Wh–?! Not here!”

Vaporeon (innocently):

“Just distracting you from cursed dialogue starters, dear.”

Regigigas (muffled, from a wall-mounted tablet wedged into the corner):

“I CAN’T BREATHE IN PIXELS, PLEASE STOP TEASING EACH OTHER, ”

He was currently wall-clipped into a suffocation loop, eyes twitching as memories of Greedent’s unfinished sentence looped in his cursed neural net.

Keldeo (not looking up):

“Reminder: install Flashback Machine parental filters.”

Gardevoir (writing notes calmly):

“Also: install psychic firewalls against perversion triggers. They age poorly.”

Alolan Ninetales (sipping a snowcone):

“It’s okay. I still think building a beacon that size sounds worse than Regigigas' loop.”

Everyone nodded in agreement, even the tablet buzzed sadly, acknowledging the truth.

Lil Eve:

“So what’s next, lava surfing with obsidian fins or, ”

Tablet (Regigigas' final scream of the day):

“NO MORE FLASHBACKS!!”

The ship drifted onward, the immortals relaxed, the cringe contained, for now.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

[Scene: Lush Planet “Erosbloom-89” – 69 Years After Landing]

Verdant vines stretched skyward as flowers pulsed softly in time with the planet’s heartbeat. The Hourai Immortals, eternally young yet cosmically seasoned, wandered its alien Eden with a bizarre serenity only billions of years could cultivate.

-

Lil Eve and Keldeo strolled side-by-side under glowing moss canopies. Their gakuran and seifuku fluttered as pollen shimmered in the air.

Suddenly, ahead: Two human figures, seemingly locked in perpetual embrace.

A muscular man in a futuristic quarterback uniform, carrying his wife, a cheerleader with glasses, tightly hugged in bridal style. Their smiles sparkled as they floated rather than walked. Occasionally, they exchanged gentle kisses like it was still their honeymoon, 3 billion years ago.

Keldeo:

“...Are we hallucinating this?”

Lil Eve’s tail glowed bright pink in embarrassment, a full-on tail boner, spiking her skirt and radiating unfiltered moe shock.

Cheerleader Woman (smiling warmly):

“Aww, you two are adorable! Especially you, little one. May I pet you?”

Lil Eve (still frozen):

“T-Tail… b-bonerrrr…”

Keldeo (gentle sigh):

“Here we go again…”

He lifted Lil Eve bridal style, her face steaming as he turned toward the cheerleader, who gently stroked Lil Eve’s head with motherly affection.

Cheerleader:

“Soft like starlight...”

Then, 

RRRAAGHHRGGHHHH!!!

A muffled screech erupted from Keldeo’s back, yes, it was Regigigas, still strapped in his Tablet of Eternal Loop, dying from sheer cringe suffocation.

Lil Eve (snapping):

“THAT’S ENOUGH!”

She jumped off and unleashed Pulsive Foul Play, smacking the tablet with a grassy shockwave that muted Regigigas’ cries mid-gurgle.

Lil Eve (bowing):

“Forgive us. He’s… a walking embarrassment.”

Quarterback Man (still holding his wife):

“Been there. Respect, young ones.”

Cheerleader Woman (still stroking Lil Eve’s ears):

“Come visit again.”

After a respectful farewell, Lil Eve, cheeks flushed and giddy, suddenly sprouted vines and bride-lifted Keldeo in return, her seifuku fluttering as they flew into the treetops.

-

Meanwhile, on another continent…

Vaporeon, still in her maid swimsuit, carried Flareon across mountain peaks. The "One-Year Maid Carry Challenge" was reaching month 11.

Ninetales and Gardevoir, sitting nearby under parasol shades, politely ignored alien suitors who tried pick-up lines ranging from galaxy poems to poor haikus.

Then, they saw it:

A human woman in classic seifuku, forever carrying her blushing gakuran-clad husband, bridal-style. She had been doing so for 2.5 billion years, and still wasn’t tired.

Seifuku Woman (grinning):

“You four are so cute! Real marriage material.”

Gakuran Man (softly):

“She’s the strongest lifeform I know…”

Flareon (to Vaporeon):

“I feel slightly under-carried now.”

Gardevoir (murmuring):

“This planet… is deliciously unhinged.”

She sipped her cosmic coffee and stared into the middle distance.

“We’re not leaving anytime soon.”

And no one disagreed. Even the Regigigas Tablet tried to clap… before breaking itself again in cringe silence.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

[Scene: Lush Planet “Erosbloom-89” – Galactic Café, Under the Mind-Coral Pavilion]

A quiet breeze brushed over the amphitheater, where various immortal and post-mortal lifeforms lounged on coral recliners and drank fluorescent smoothies. All was peaceful until Gardevoir, dressed eternally in her pencil skirt police-uniform ensemble, stood on a psychically conjured platform, giving a calm lecture.

Gardevoir:

“Through consistent exposure to multidimensional minds, I’ve perfected a psychic field that nullifies language barriers across the galaxy. Meaning is conveyed directly, bypassing syntax, ”

She gestured gently as even non-carbon-based aliens blinked in awe, understanding words they never knew existed.
Keldeo and Lil Eve, holding hands near a levitating bonsai tree, looked on in stunned silence.
Even the Death Loop Tablet on Keldeo’s back vibrated briefly in reverent understanding.

Then… from the side…

Alolan Ninetales, lounging on a frosty couch in her light blue sundress, raised a paw and commented dryly:

Ninetales:

“She’s just a Nine Ball.”

Gardevoir:

“...Thank you.”

And that was when trouble arrived.

-

From behind a psychic pillar, an Octopus-shaped Yuri Fanboy Alien with hearts for eyes burst forth, flailing tentacles and gurgling in passion.

Octopus Alien:

“LESBIANS. ON. SCREEN.”

He pointed dramatically at Gardevoir and Alolan Ninetales, who blinked at each other.

There was a long pause.

Then, with perfectly neutral expressions, they gently leaned in and kissed, brief, soft, and aesthetically correct, like they were checking off a galactic request form.

Gardevoir (telepathically):

“Sorry, Lucario.”

Ninetales (telepathically):

“Apologies, Mamoswine.”

The Octopus alien wept tears of joy, bowed, and floated away satisfied.

Meanwhile, 

Regigigas, still imprisoned in his Death Loop Tablet, witnessed it all. His tablet shook violently, and a pixelated ROCK BONER icon popped up. In sheer shame and overstimulation, the loop force-ejected itself into the nearest interplanetary shredder, with a muffled scream trailing off:

Regigigas:

“I REGRET NOTHINGGG, grrhhhkk, ”

A pause.

Gardevoir:

“He’ll respawn. Again.”

Ninetales:

“One day, he’ll stop screaming. I hope.”

They both sipped their cosmic drinks, the breeze now slightly more awkward.

Lil Eve (to Keldeo):

“...Do you think they’re actually into each other now?”

Keldeo:

“I think they’re into not saying they’re into each other.”

The girls exchanged a silent glance.
Somewhere, a bisexual awakening softly bloomed like pollen in the air.

-

And thus, on a planet full of cuddle couples, alien voyeurs, and resurrecting cringe legends, the immortals carried on.

Forever serene. Forever weird. Forever unhinged.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Scene:
As the crew lounges in their interstellar living room, the Death Loop Tablet begins flickering violently. Flareon lazily lifts a paw, glancing at it with mild disinterest.

Tablet Display: Regigigas flailing in an uncanny yellow lake, face twisted in slow-motion horror. No audio, only a subtitle: “No smell detected.”

Vaporeon: “Did we forget to flush another simulation?”

Alolan Ninetales (sipping an iced drink): “Don’t look at me. I’m ice-type.”

Gardevoir: “...Should we help him?”

Keldeo: “He’ll reset in 15 seconds anyway.”

Lil Eve (giggling): “He always makes it weird.”

Regigigas (subtitled as he sinks): “I have seen eternity. It smells like nothing.”

The crew goes back to watching soap operas from a parallel universe.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Scene: A breezy afternoon on the deck of the ship orbiting a lush, green planet.

Vaporeon and Lil Eve walk in confidently, tails swaying with suspicious pride. Under their frilly skirts, very noticeable oval bulges jiggle with each step.

Flareon (squinting): “...Again?”

Keldeo (deadpan, arms crossed): “Third time this century.”

Vaporeon (grinning): “It’s tradition!”

Lil Eve (mock-innocent): “We wanted to see if you'd cry again.”

Flareon dramatically drops onto his back, tail twitching.
Keldeo just sighs, pulling out a tiny terraforming control device.

Keldeo: “Alright, that’s it. We’re making a planet where Pokémon mortals can live. With pranks banned by law.”

Flareon: “And no oval-shaped anything.”

Regigigas, faintly from the tablet on the table: “Too late… I choked on one... again…”

Everyone ignores him.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Scene: 69 years after the terraforming project, lush valleys sprawl beneath a violet sky, speckled with two suns and a slow orbiting moon made of crystal.

Lil Eve sits beneath a massive glowing tree whose roots hum softly in tune with the soil. Around her gather her descendants, some furred, some scaled, others shimmering with alien traits inherited from unknown corners of the multiverse.

One of her newly born siblings, a Steel-type Eeveelution with chrome fur and luminous, gear-shaped tail fins, sits beside her. His eyes, devoid of pupils, lock onto the flickering Regigigas tablet resting on a mossy stone.

Steelvee: “...Is he always like that?”

The tablet screen shows Regigigas being slowly crushed by two planetary-scale magnets. No sound, just a looping image of his metal frame folding like scrap.

Lil Eve: “Yes. He says it’s better than the shark tank, though.”

A tall, sleek Cosmician Rapidash, one of her children, now grown, approaches, his black flames speckled with fuchsia stars and vapor trails. He squints at the tablet.

Cosmician Rapidash: “He knows we can turn it off, right?”

Lil Eve: “I think he finds meaning in the suffering.”

Steelvee: “Cosmic masochism... noted.”

Lil Eve chuckles softly and gazes up at the dual suns. Her leafy tail sways with contentment and unease alike.

Lil Eve (softly): “From Pokétopia… to this. The universe sure knows how to unhinge.”

The camera slowly zooms out, the laughter of her mixed kin echoing faintly, while Regigigas silently gets pancaked again in the background.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Scene: The terraformed planet, early evening. Bioluminescent plants begin to glow. Lil Eve's family sprawls across a serene garden-plateau, some relaxing, some playing, some just... existing.

A moment of quiet.

Then, 

Steelvee (standing atop a rock, dramatically raising a chunk of scrap metal like a guitar):
“I… AM STEELVEE!!”
His voice inexplicably echoing in perfect Jack Black impersonation.

A record-scratch level silence pierces the air.

In the nearby moss-den gaming alcove, Alolan Ninetales and a newly introduced Dragon-type Eeveelution (coiling tail, pastel scales, and ethereal antennae) are locked in a fierce bullet hell danmaku battle on a holographic screen.

Ninetales (mid-dodge, expression icy): “Don’t.”

Dragonvee (laser-focused): “Ignore the cringe, dodge the crin...”

Too late.
Both characters get sniped by a curtain of pink star-bullets.
GAME OVER flashes across the sky.

Ninetales (deadpan): “Great. Now I have to restart Lunatic Mode.”

Dragonvee (hissing): “His cringe has splash damage.”

Back by the rock, Steelvee bows with over-the-top flair. Lil Eve just buries her face in her leaf-paws, laughing.

Meanwhile, in the background, the Regigigas tablet flickers alive just to show him slapping his own stone face in sheer defeat.

Regigigas (muffled): “...Why am I still here… just to suffer…”

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Scene: Twilight on the terraformed planet. The stars begin to shine, and the descendants of the immortal circle gather around flickering archives of memory, gifted from the ones who came before.

Lil Eve, after a long day in inherited Leafeon form, finally blinks and shifts back to her base Eevee form with a soft pop and a leafy sigh.

Lil Eve (rubbing her head):
“Oops… forgot Gramps mode was still on. No wonder I was photosynthesizing all afternoon.”

Nearby, Steelvee, her new and same cosmic but mortal brother, ever the curious gearhead, sits cross-legged with a hovering Cosmic Flashback Tape, its core glowing with blue and orange, Flareon’s color signature. He inserts it into an old projector-flask.

The tape plays:
Crustle, long gone, appears in vintage stream overlays, fidgeting in his first attempt at NaclCraft. The commentary is janky, the gameplay clunky, but there’s charm, genuine joy in the grind as he builds a beacon slowly, one salt brick at a time.

Steelvee chuckles, adjusting his armor plates.
“Dad said this was peak stream-core... I kinda get it now.”

From across the grove, Dragonvee, the dignified, airy female Dragon-type, carefully reactivates a Mystic Vales Chronicle highlight tape, gifted long ago by Vaporeon herself.

The scene:
Galarian Rapidash, elegant and stern, dances across a bullet hell battlefield. No damage taken. Not even grazed. The music is intense; her horn sparkles with starfire. A frame-perfect lunatic-mode performance.

Dragonvee (quietly):
“She did it all for the playerbase... not even for the score. Just so others could believe it’s possible.”

Lil Eve joins them, ears twitching gently.

“I miss them sometimes,” she murmurs, “even if we’re... not alone.”

The air hums, not with sorrow, but with resonance. Their ancestors are gone, but through archives, DNA, and legacy, they’re still right here. Watching. Inspiring.

In the background, the Regigigas tablet turns on, showing him sighing through bloodied slapstick trauma.

Regigigas (muffled):
“You’re welcome, by the way. I carried the cringe so you don’t have to.”

Steelvee tosses him a tiny salt cube in tribute.

“Rest easy, stone uncle.”

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Scene: The family grove on the terraformed planet, beneath bioluminescent trees glowing softly in the dusk. The immortal trio, Keldeo, Vaporeon, Flareon, arrive silently, still dressed in their immortal uniforms as if time refused to move around them. Lil Eve, unchanged too, curls her tail as her many descendants respectfully step aside.

-

A Flashback Tape floats from Steelvee’s archive projector. It whirs and glows:

A much younger Flareon, bruised and limping in a battered quarterback uniform, limps out from a foggy football field.

Then, Vaporeon, youthful and radiant in her pleated cheerleader skirt, scoops him up bridal-style without hesitation.

The tape glitches. The locker room floods out of nowhere, water sloshing from every pipe.

Cramorant, in the shadows, gulping guiltily and flapping wildly under Mr. Mime's orders.

-

Steelvee and Dragonvee exchange snickers.

-

The projector clicks, jumping forward 13 years into the next tape.

Cramorant, older now, wearing a sunhat and vest, stands calmly by a lakeside stall handing out fish wrapped in seaweed.

Flareon, now in a modest apron, quickly slaps coins onto the counter and grabs the fish, but flinches.

He turns, Buzzwole is there, posing dramatically with a bento box.

They lock eyes.

Buzzwole screams internally and flees full sprint, crashing through a billboard and vaulting into the distant forest toward Urshifu's manor.

The tape ends. The descendants giggle.

-

Back in the present, Flareon exhales deeply.
“They both moved on... but I swear, Buzzwole still avoids anything spicy to this day.”

Vaporeon leans over, kissing him on the cheek gently.
“You helped them survive their pasts. Now you’ve outlived yours.”

Keldeo, standing tall beside them, adds quietly:
“And their stories live in our blood. Cringe and all.”

The breeze carries laughter, past and future merging softly. A few young Eevee descendants are already reenacting the locker room flood scene with plushies.

Lil Eve, still in her sailor uniform, whispers with a smirk,
“Should we tell them the library bento incident was technically my fault?”

Flareon and Vaporeon, in perfect sync:
“No.”

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

[Scene: The Descendant’s Grove, nightfall. Glowing vines hum faintly. Lil Eve sits among her siblings and children, projector humming as another tape loads in.]

(Saga 3 recap kinda...)

The title blinks on screen:
“Origin Tape 3: The Bento, the Bot, and the Birth”

It begins with Cramorant, sneaking from the library's chest. He grabs a bento box, not knowing it belonged to Espeon, Flareon's powerful psychic mother.

The box then swalloed by Cramorant, then he was seen catching Flareon, as Cramorant was trying to eat him mid-air until rescued by Vaporeon. Traumatized, his tail sticks out at a 90-degree angle for a full hour.

Espeon was already collapsed after her DNA stolen during the commotion.

-

The footage glitches, cutting to a Bot War Raid at school.

Espeonbot, a mechanical doppelganger with glowing red eyes, assaults the school with an army of Sylveonbot, Absolbot, and Pikabot.

Flareon, mid-meltdown, is rescued by a swift Vaporeon, clad in her school uniform skirt. She bridal-carries him out of the collapsing entrance room, shielding him from other rogue bots.

The projector shows the two resting under moonlight at Vaporeon's room, Flareon recovering, held tightly in Vaporeon's arms. Espeon watches from afar the next morning after the war was over, her cold demeanor melting.

A voiceover, Espeon’s psychic tone:

“I never ordered it... but I allowed it. For once, I trusted love more than legacy.”

-

Then:

Months later, baby Lil Eve was born inside Umbreon's hospital. Her tail sparkles. Vaporeon (in bed) and Flareon cry silently. Espeon and the rest of eeveelution family, Umbreon (grandpa and hospital owner), Glaceon (grandma), Leafeon (grandpa), Jolteon (honorary uncle) and Sylveon (honorary aunt) looked on, distant but softened.

Back in the present, the tape ends. The hum fades.

-

Lil Eve sits still, eyes moist but smiling.
“So... I was born from a stolen bento, a bot war, and trauma hugs.”

Steelvee, quietly:
“Best origin story I’ve heard since Buzzwole’s boxing match with Wigglytuff.”

Flareon, nostalgic:
“I’d suffer it all again. A thousand bentos. A million bots.”

Vaporeon reaches over, nuzzling her daughter.

Lil Eve replies, hugging both of her parents.
“I’m glad you did.”

A new star twinkles in the terraformed sky. The grove breathes. The future is weird, but loved.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

[Scene: The Descendant’s Grove, again. The vines hum as a deeper, older tape clicks into the projector. The screen flickers into sepia tones, this is before even the first saga.]

Title card:
“Prologue Tape: The Bandit, The Betrayal, and The Heroes”

It begins in a dust-worn village, half-lit by lanterns. A starving Pikachu, cloaked in tattered fabric, stumbles behind a merchant stall, clutching his stomach.

A silent shadow approaches. It's Umbreon, stoic and calm, dropping a wrapped rice ball without a word. Pikachu devours it, gasping.

Pikachu:
“You… you're kind. Are you a hero?”

Umbreon stares out into the stars.

Umbreon:
“No. I’m just missing someone.”

He mumbles about Espeon, his lost girlfriend, kidnapped not long ago by a former childhood friend: Tyranitar, twisted by power.

Pikachu:
“N-not my business, sir...”

Umbreon grips Pikachu by the tail.

Umbreon:
“It is now.”

The tape freezes there.

-

Back in the present, Lil Eve, eyes reflecting the projector's light, exhales.

Lil Eve:
“Grandpa Umbreon was strict even when he was saving lives. Now I get why Dad turned out the way he did.”

-

[Another tape clunks in, older still.]

Title card:
“114 Years Before Tyranitar Clash: The Scam That Shook the Titans”

A golden desert. Regigigas and the other Regis gather around an interdimensional flip phone.

Regice (on speaker):
“They say the deposit makes us immortal. We just have to wire, ”

Regigigas:
“Perfect. I trust this. I’m a genius.”

Moments later, a cosmic explosion. They're left bruised, mortal, and broke.

Enraged, Regigigas begins forging a glowing needle, his “Anti-Arceus Lance.” The scene glitches before the fatal confrontation can be shown.

-

Cut to present day.

Regigigas, now skewered one hundred times over by poetic irony, watches the tape playing.

He coughs, half-immortal blood leaking.

Regigigas:
“I regret nothing!”

Then pauses. Screams.

Regigigas:
“Actually, maybe a little bit!”

-

The projector powers down. The grove falls silent again.

Reality itself seems to chuckle in the vines.

The past is chaotic. The future is weird.
But for now, the immortals rest, amused… and still watching.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

[Scene: The same planet, glimmering under a twin sunset. The ice bridge arcs across a vast chasm, suspended in cold mist.]

Alolan Ninetales, regal and graceful, conjures the bridge with elegant sweeps of her tails, layering frost into shimmering threads for everyone to cross.

Keldeo, impatient, surfs ahead at high speed, blades of water sparking as hooves kiss the ice.

Gardevoir glides after him, not touching the surface, psychic energy cradles her in perfect poise.

Lil Eve, humming to herself, crafts delicate Frost Prints into the shape of custom skates, made entirely from charged ice. She rides them with finesse, initiating an Electric Drift as her ribbon tail sparks behind her.

Flareon, determined but incompatible with the medium, takes a single step.

Hissssss.

The ice under him steams and crumbles. He yelps, sinking waist-deep, but before panic can rise, 

Vaporeon, swift as ever, dives in and lifts him bridal-style, rising from the fog like a soft rescue cliché.

Alolan Ninetales, amused but practiced, calls out as they float by:

Ninetales:
“That’s the six hundred sixty-nine millionth time, you two. Should I start charging rescue fees?”

Flareon (grumbling):
“I was doing fine.”

Vaporeon:
“Sure you were.”

As laughter echoes across the bridge, Keldeo loses control for once, slipping on a curve, sending a strange black object skittering from his saddlebag.

It bounces once, twice, and slides off the bridge’s edge.

Death Loop Tablet.

Cutaway:

Far below, Regigigas, still recovering from psychic trauma and poetic irony, opens one eye as the tablet whizzes past his head.

Regigigas:
“Oh no. Not again.”

Cue the familiar fin of a Sharpedo emerging from dimensional slush nearby.

-

Back at the far side of the bridge, awaiting the others:

- Steelvee, arms crossed, scanning.

- Dragonvee, wings gently flapping, yawning in disinterest.

- Galaxian Gastrier, glowing with constellation marks, ears twitching at the psychic distress call.

- Cosmician Rapidash, mane flickering with astral flames, watches silently.

Galaxian Gastrier, with a calm breath, extends her hand toward the abyss. Her eyes glow, and water from mist and psychic energy swirl together into a spiral.

She lifts the tablet mid-fall, slows it, and pulls it toward her with care, handing it to Steelvee.

Steelvee:
“We’re going to need to lock this thing up.”

Dragonvee:
“Or just stop inviting Keldeo to casual travel.”

Rapidash (finally speaking):
“…Too late for that.”

- 

Everyone eventually gathers on the other side. The bridge holds. The sun dims. The night is young.

Another cosmic accident has been narrowly avoided.

But just barely.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

[Scene: Inside a glowing crystal den carved into the side of a mountain. Aurora vines pulse faintly above as a screen flickers. Lil Eve sits with a controller, immersed.]

On-screen:
A pixelated platformer. Two elemental characters, one fire, one water, solve puzzles cooperatively, triggering levers and avoiding traps.

Lil Eve (grinning):
“Go, Dadbot! Hit the switch! No, not into the lake again!”

Her Fire character sizzles out dramatically in the in-game water. Again.

From behind, Flareon peeks over her shoulder, puffing his cheeks.

Flareon:
“That game’s rigged. No way fire types slip that much in real life.”

Vaporeon, leaning against the den’s wall with a cup of moss tea, doesn’t even look up.

Vaporeon:
“Says the one who melted his way into a ravine this morning.”

Flareon:
“That was terrain sabotage!”

Lil Eve (laughing):
“Mom had to spoon you out again.”

Cue a flashback ripple:

Vaporeon, expression flat, stands in waist-high water with a literal ladle made of hardened bubble energy, scooping a soggy Flareon from a crater lake while Ninetales in the background silently counts with her tail.

Back to present.

Flareon, shaking imaginary water from his ears, mutters:

Flareon:
“…You call it rescue. I call it aquatic abduction.”

Vaporeon (gently):
“You’re still warm. It’s cute.”

Lil Eve (playfully smug):
“I think you two were the original Fireboy and Watergirl.”

Both parents glance at the screen. The pixel characters hold hands after solving a puzzle.

A moment of quiet. Flareon and Vaporeon exchange a glance.

Vaporeon:
“…Okay, that’s pretty poetic.”

Flareon (blushing):
“D’aww…”

-

Cutaway panel:

Meanwhile, Regigigas, his consciousness still partly bound to the Tablet of Eternal Mistakes, is sitting inside a volcano.

He hums as molten lava bubbles around him, using it like bathwater.

Regigigas:
“They mocked me once. Who’s the fool now?”

The Death Loop Tablet, floating nearby the gaming scene, begins flashing red. Again.

Regigigas (sighing):
“Not again.”

Galaxian Sharpedo fin (fire-type) breach from lava.

-

Back at the den, Lil Eve starts a new level. Vaporeon settles beside her. Flareon sits on the other side, tail curled close to avoid scorching the rug.

They play together. This time, Flareon almost makes the jump.

Almost.

Splash.

Lil Eve:
“Six hundred sixty-nine million and one.”

Flareon:
“I'm starting to think it's fate.”

Vaporeon (already conjuring her spoon):
“Good thing I kept this handy.”

The screen glows on. Outside, the stars begin to fall upward.

A low-stakes evening, in a high-concept world.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

[Scene: The Descendant’s Grove. Lil Eve has set up a side projector for a "spin-off spin-off night." The film begins with charming, orchestral music,  whimsical, hopeful.]

Title Card:
“Firegirl & Waterboy: A Tale of Steam”

Starring: Firefox & Frogger

Act 1: Emberport

Firefox, a fire-elemental fox with glowing script patterns on her tail and a mischievous spark in her stride, lives in Emberport, a glowing city of warm light and controlled chaos. She runs her family’s incense bakery, where the air smells of cinnamon and static. Inspired by Delphox.

Enter Frogger, a cool blue swamp-dwelling water boy with slick reflexes, wide-set eyes, and a quiet voice. He arrives in Emberport as a delivery runner, skating along pipes and vapor trails with his custom water-slick boots. Inspired by Greninja.

Their first meeting is literal: he crashes through her bakery’s steam vent window.

Firefox (deadpan):
“You owe me seven buns and a wall.”

Frogger (blinking):
“Do you... take payment in puddlecoin?”

-

Act 2: Sparks & Splashes

They don’t like each other. Then they don’t not like each other. Then... they’re racing down the city’s molten slideways together, dodging hover-carts, co-steaming dumplings, and arguing about the ethics of water extinguishing scented candles.

Montage moments:

They compete in an Elemental Dance Festival and accidentally invent “steam-syncing” (the crowd goes wild).

Frogger teaches Firefox to relax in a hot spring.

Firefox tries to teach Frogger how to handle spice. He cries and eats more.

-

Act 3: Flood & Flame

A sudden infrastructure glitch causes Emberport’s heat to spike dangerously. The city faces a risk of evaporation... or meltdown.

Together, Firefox and Frogger devise a plan using their combined powers, he cools the flow lines while she redirects energy to prevent a chain reaction. It’s awkward, messy, heartfelt.

As they succeed, a steam cloud rises, painting the sky in rose and violet hues.

-

Final Scene:

They sit on the edge of a copper tower, city safe below. Her tail flickers. His webbed hands rest in hers.

Frogger:
“You’re not as explosive as I thought.”

Firefox:
“And you’re wetter than I expected.”

They laugh. A soft kiss. Then the camera pans up to a sky where clouds and sun rays swirl like brushstrokes.

-

Back in the reality:

Lil Eve giggles.
“This is exactly like how you two flirted when I was still just an egg.”

Flareon hides his face.
“I wasn’t that awkward.”

Vaporeon just grins.
“You melted the school’s hydration fountain.”

The grove hums with laughter. Another surreal love story... Firefox and Frogger, characters inspired by the couple of the seer and the bounty hunter and old allies back then they were there, Delphox and Greninja, but with their own identities. With just enough steam to feel real.

End credits theme: A duet called “Boil and Flow.”

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

[Scene: The Descendant’s Grove, Night. The vines pulse gently as another old reel spins up. Lil Eve munches popcorn made of crystallized berries. A familiar hum buzzes the clearing.]

Title Card:
“Flashback Tape: The Double Date of Boil & Flow”
(Year 11 of the 13-year gap, Lil Eve was age 11)

-

[Cut to: A glowing evening patio in a ritzy Elemental Cuisine Lounge. A gentle stream flows beneath a transparent floor. Waiters float on lily pads. The ambiance is soaked in soft light and steamy aromas.]

At the 2x2 table:

- Vaporeon, elegant in a flowing blue date dress, sits beside

- Flareon, dashing and nervous in a crisp red tuxedo.

Across from them:

- Greninja, wearing a sharp shounen protagonist-style suit with exaggerated shoulder flair and dual belts, his eyes hidden behind calm determination.

- Delphox, serene in a shoujo mage-style gown, sleeves draped like comet tails, her ears adorned with tiny lantern charms.

-

The table is split perfectly.

- Greninja and Vaporeon share the cool side: chilled fruit soups, frozen cocktails, mist-infused mochi.

- Delphox and Flareon share the spicy side: magma noodles, ember dumplings, firecracker skewers.

Greninja (coolly sipping frost tea):
“Arrested four bandits before sunrise. They were smuggling counterfeit Evolution Stones in soda cans.”

Delphox (without looking up):
“Mmm. That explains the third moon in your fortune today.”

Flareon (choking slightly on a fire dumpling):
“I-Is that why the waiter called you Officer Frog?”

Vaporeon (grinning):
“He’s technically a bounty hunter. But I think it’s the belts.”

-

Greninja suddenly stands, scooping up Delphox bridal style in a smooth, practiced motion.

Greninja:
“We’ve steamed long enough.”

He places a glowing receipt gently on the table, its numbers absurd, enough to buy a pool the size of a city plaza.

In a blink, they vanish in a swirl of mist and psychic light.

-

Flareon (blinking):
“They left.”

Vaporeon (grabbing the receipt):
“And left the grace to us.”

Without hesitation, she sweeps Flareon into a bridal carry, tails brushing the stone steps as they stride away from the glowing patio, past stunned waiters and flickering lanterns.

[Cue soft piano melody.]

The camera pans up to the crescent moon, framed by steam and starlight.

-

[Back in the present, Lil Eve sighs dreamily.]

Lil Eve:
“That was your most theatrical date ever... and you weren’t even the dramatic couple.”

Vaporeon (smirking):
“They inspired the dramatics.”

Flareon (blushing):
“I only wore the tux because I lost a bet.”

Steelvee (offscreen):
“You two are the reason I trust water and fire type synergy.”

The projector dims. The grove chuckles. The romance lingers in the leaves.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

[Scene: The same vibrant, terraformed planet. Noon. A crystalline sky hums above rustling alien forests. Lil Eve walks a floating trail of semi-organic stones, humming to herself.]

[Suddenly: The path ends.]

Bugvee (female), a twitchy, mischievous Bug-type Eevee with antennae made from woven moss and a leaf-pod tail ,  has constructed a towering barricade of alien cicada shells, their translucent forms still echoing with chirps from another ecosystem.

Bugvee (smirking):
"None shall pass, unless they love bugs."

Lil Eve (raising an eyebrow):
"I do love bugs. Just... warm."

She casually walks forward, leaving behind a Flamethrower Trail, the flames licking up the shells without harming the flora. They pop and vanish with soft “plink” sounds like bubble wrap. The path clears.

Bugvee (sighs):
“That's not entomologically respectful... but fair.”

-

[Moments later: The ground rumbles.]

Groundvee (male), a stoic Ground-type Eevee with mineral-crusted fur and eyes like cracked opals ,  rises up from a fissure in the path. The terrain splits and quakes in a miniature earthquake.

Groundvee (monotone):
“None shall pass... unless they respect tremors.”

Lil Eve:
“I do. But I also respect dry skin a little less.”

She leaps, forming a Surfing Waterfall beneath her feet. The crashing water rushes through the quake, saturating the soil and silencing the tremors in a gentle hiss. She lands neatly on the re-stabilized path.

Groundvee (sighs):
“Tectonics are underappreciated.”

-

Lil Eve (grinning at both):
"You two realize you're pulling pranks that are type-weak to your own sister... whose parents are literally Fireboy and Watergirl."

Bugvee (defensively):
“It’s called type-acceptance therapy.”

Groundvee (gruffly):
“...I just wanted someone to admire my plates.”

-

[All three start walking together. The path ahead glows faintly in tune with their steps.]

Lil Eve (smiling):
“You know, this is the weirdest family ever. I wouldn’t trade it for anything.”

The cicada shell remnants echo one last chirp. The path reforms. A leaf flutters by in a gust of stardust.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

[Scene: The outer edges of a bioluminescent canyon, same planet, late afternoon. Unstable terrain marked by strange fungi and floating boulders. The air hums with odd tension.]

[Enter: Rockvee (male) ,  wide, silent, and always seen stacking rocks in increasingly absurd shapes. A balanced sculpture resembling a golem’s face teeters behind him.]

Rockvee (quietly, to himself):
“One more pebble... and balance is real.”

[Nearby: Poisonvee (female) ,  elegant but eerie, with bioluminescent stripes and toxic bloom petals along her tail ,  pokes at a cluster of extraterrestrial mushrooms that breathe when touched.]

Poisonvee (softly):
“These could paralyze an Onix... or make great nail polish.”

-

[Suddenly: chaos.]

Steelvee ,  still channeling angry Jack Black energy, chrome-slick and loud ,  storms in, clanging his shoulder plates together.

Steelvee (yelling):
“ROCKVEE, YOUR STACK SUCKS!”

Rockvee (turning slowly):
“You insulted sediment.”

[They charge. A boulder is thrown, a steel beam snapped.]

-

[Elsewhere: Poisonvee and Dragonvee face off.]

Dragonvee (female) ,  serpentine and cosmic-hued, floating just above the ground in a perpetual low-hover, wings made of aurora-light.

Dragonvee (snarling):
“Toxic mushrooms again? That’s your obsession.”

Poisonvee (hissing):
“At least I don’t sniff comets and pretend it's ‘aesthetic.’”

[Tail lashes and psychic bursts flare.]

-

[Enter: Lil Eve. Calm. Radiant. Holding a sandwich mid-bite.]

Lil Eve (sighs):
“Alright. Playtime's over.”

[She tosses the sandwich and enters battle mode.]

- Dazzling Gleam, a blinding flash across the sky, strikes Dragonvee, who yelps and spirals into a bush.

- Psybeam Focus, a tight spiral of light, locks Poisonvee mid-leap, trapping her in a dizzy hover.

- Surfing Waterfall, a smooth wall of water, crashes down onto Rockvee, flattening his stack into skipping stones.

- Flamethrower Trail, hot and elegant, singes Steelvee’s edges as she skates past him.

Steelvee (arms wide, yelling as sparks fly):
“I... AM STEELVEE!!”

Lil Eve (deadpan):
“Yeah, and I’m your fire extinguisher.”

[She flicks his nose with a final Ember. Steelvee dramatically crumples.]

Steelvee (softly):
“I... surrender... but... still Steelvee...”

-

[Up on a crystalline cliff, watching silently: Flareon and Vaporeon. Flareon is leaning against her; Vaporeon has a drink made of cloudfruit.]

Flareon (quietly, nostalgic):
“Our chaos extended family... so very us.”

Vaporeon (smiling):
“I blame you.”

Flareon:
“Fair.”

[Below, Lil Eve raises her arms. The kids groan, but start helping each other up.]

Vaporeon:
“She’s got it handled.”

Flareon:
“She is the balance point.”

[They watch the sun bend like a prism over the canyon. The future is weird, and they wouldn’t have it any other way.]

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

[Scene: The neon mist of the lower forest, thick with floating spores and luminous pollen. Lil Eve wanders through the glowing underbrush, tail flickering gently. Her senses tingle.]

Lil Eve (to herself, tired but amused):
“Another elemental sibling cluster. I can smell the pranks already.”

-

[Pan to a grassy glade where the next trio hangs out with older siblings.]

- Fightvee (male): Shirtless martial artist vibes, bandaged paws and a constant bounce in his step. Sparring with air.

- Flyvee (female): Light and carefree, hovering just above the grass, wind spiraling gently around her.

- Ghostvee (male): Shaded, partially translucent. His eyes glow dimly like candles under water. A gentle smile but slightly haunting.

Nearby: Bugvee and Groundvee chilling like tired camp counselors.

Bugvee (sipping mushroom tea):
“They’re the youngest batch. Haven’t wrecked a building yet. I’m proud.”

Groundvee (grunting):
“Yet.”

-

Lil Eve steps forward. Ghostvee notices her and floats closer.

Ghostvee (softly, wistful):
“Do you wanna know how I evolved?”

Lil Eve (smiling):
“Always.”

Ghostvee (looking to the stars above):
“I ran away after stealing sweets. Slipped off a cliff in a cave that shouldn’t exist. Found a soul gem mid-fall. Caught it. Felt myself... unmake... and remake.”

Bugvee (dry):
“He came back glowing and said, ‘Oops.’”

Groundvee:
“We all had therapy.”

Lil Eve (smirking):
“That's the most Ghostvee way to evolve.”

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

[Scene: The glowing glade fades into surreal low gravity as Lil Eve watches from the thistle-throne of moss and woven vines.]

[Across the floating field, Keldeo is now surrounded by nine glowing emblems suspended in the air, each one pulsing with a different elemental aura.]

A Cosmician Claydol speaks in monotone grandeur:

Cosmician Claydol:
“Keldeo of the Azure Spiral, you have been chosen for the Nine Elemental Trials.
These are your challenges: Bug, Fighting, Rock, Flying, Ground, Poison, Steel, Dragon, and Ghost.
Complete them, and ascend as the Cosmic Knight Prime of Balance and Buffoonery.”

Keldeo (nervous):
“...That last part wasn’t necessary.”

-

[Cut to Lil Eve watching from afar, crouched behind a gently levitating boulder.]

Lil Eve (sighs, amused):
“Here we go again. But this time, it’s his turn to get emotionally pulverized by symbolic elements.”

Ghostvee (hovering beside her):
“He’s gonna fail the Ghost Trial. No one’s ever ready for the mirror full of dead dreams.”

Bugvee (arms crossed):
“Bug Trial’s underrated. Giant cicada queen makes you relive every time you didn’t believe in yourself. Brutal.”

Groundvee (eating mud granola):
“Steel Trial turns your emotions into metal. You gotta literally forge your own heart. I cried.”

-

[Lil Eve stands up, tail glowing.]

Lil Eve (grinning):
“I better pack two towels, some Full Heals, and a big hug for after the Fighting Trial.”

[As Keldeo fumbles through his first trial, a temple made entirely of toxic mushrooms (Poison Trial), his allies and weird family watch from across the warped horizon, cheering, groaning, or taking bets.]

The grove sparkles. Absurdity blooms. The weird saga continues.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

[Scene: Beneath a twinkling double-moon sky, Flareon and Vaporeon sit side-by-side on a hovering terrace of polished crystal moss, watching Keldeo stumble through the chaotic Poison Trial, where a pool of bubbling purple goo sings opera at him.]

Vaporeon (squinting):
“…That’s supposed to be the Water Trial?”
(gestures to the bubbling pool as a poison octopus throws sarcasm at Keldeo)
“My original trial was about learning to flow with direction. To become water, not drown in it.”

Flareon (grumbling):
“And the Fire Trial used to be about channeling one’s inner fire to create, not…”
(he points toward Keldeo being forced to flambé something called ‘Molten Custardbeast’)
“…not overcooking ancient meals made for lizard gods. What even is that?”

[Vaporeon sighs, presses a gentle button on a retro cassette remote. A reel-to-reel tape whirs. The sky dims slightly.]

Narration Tape: “Lil Eve: The Original Trials”

Eight glowing glyphs shimmer in order across the mist:

1. Grass – Balance between life and decay.

2. Water – Flow with direction, not against it.

3. Fire – Use fire not for destruction, but for creation.

4. Ice – Endure and preserve even in stillness.

5. Fairy – Be present in chaos, feel without flinching.

6. Dark – Judge justice, not by light, but by shadow.

7. Psychic – Carry wisdom without the burden of control.

8. Electric – Bend the flow, not others’ will.

[The tape stops. Flareon casually tosses it into the air, where it combusts into glitter.]

Vaporeon (shaking her head, smiling):
“And now they’re just… copied. Worse, bastardized.”
(counts on fin)
“Poison tries to imitate Water. Steel took Ice’s exam and added anger. Ground’s mimicking Grass but with more tectonic guilt. Flying stole Electric’s homework. Fighting’s… Dark but with punches.”
Flareon adds dryly:
“Rock thinks it’s Fairy but is really just loud. Dragon completely misunderstood Fire. Bug thinks it’s Psychic but won’t stop buzzing.”
Vaporeon:
“…And Ghostvee’s just abusing immortality cooldowns for free retries.”

[Cut to Ghostvee lazily flying upside-down, sipping ethereal tea.]
Ghostvee:
“I learn best from posthumous failure.”

[Lil Eve, watching her boyfriend now being serenaded by sentient poison mushrooms, sighs and gets up.]

Lil Eve (stretching, then activating three moves at once):
“Well, someone’s gotta guide him through these knockoff nightmares…”
(tail flaring, water swirling, eyes glowing)
“Time for a cameo assist.”

[The elemental grove glows brighter again. The weirdly grand tale, as ever, continues.]

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

[Scene: Somewhere near the outskirts of the Elemental Trial Grounds, Regigigas, still unnaturally mobile despite being stabbed 100 times last week, hovers over the chaos below, arms crossed smugly.]

Regigigas (echoing like a broken temple bell):
“Pfft. Trials? More like playgrounds for type gimmicks. In my day we moved continents. This is baby mode.”

[He scoffs just as a faint “glorp” is heard below.]

Cue rapid-fire karma montage, Trial Style:

1. Poison Trial:
Regigigas slips, falls face-first into the poison pool. The goo sings a triumphant aria as he’s dragged under by tentacle-shaped mucus.
Poison Octopus (singing operatically):
“Ohh Giiiiiigas, you mock the test~ you now digest~”

2. Bug Trial:
Bursts out of goo, only to be swarmed by Bugvee’s alien cicada army. They start lecturing him about ancient entomological ethics while nibbling his joints.
Bugvee (mildly):
“Should’ve respected the shell stacks.”

3. Dragon Trial:
Still screeching, Regigigas is launched into the Dragon kitchen trial. A misfired Molten Custardbeast explodes on him. Flames dance, pans slap.
Dragonvee (snickering):
“He’s medium-rare now.”

4. Steel Trial:
Tries to escape but gets Iron Head’d by a steel door slamming shut on him. Then Steelvee suplexes him into a recycling furnace.
Steelvee (bellowing):
“I. AM. STEELVEEEEE!!!”

5. Ground Trial:
A quake splits the floor, Regigigas plummets into a collapsing subterranean garden. Crushed by giant dirt roses. Groundvee nods slowly.
Groundvee:
“The tectonics always win.”

6. Rock Trial:
Explodes out of the ground only to be instantly Wile-E-Coyote'd by a falling rock wall labeled “Rockvee’s Wall of Aesthetic Violence.” Blood spatters like jam.
Rockvee:
“Beauty hurts.”

7. Flying Trial:
Still limping, gets airlifted by Flying drones only to be pecked repeatedly by angry birds and swooped by aerial Sylveonbots illusions. One steals his wallet.
Flyvee (twirling midair):
“Do not question the winds, fossil.”

8. Ghost Trial:
Hauled into a mind-space by Ghostvee and a Gengar illusion. Reality distorts. Regigigas turns around, only to see his own face screaming.
Gengar (illusion, whispering):
“Death is a hallway with too many doors…”
Then they all vanish.

9. Fighting Trial:
Slams back into the arena gasping, only to be immediately met with an illusion of Machamp Requiem Mode.
Machamp Illusion (four fists pulsing, JoJo-style):
“This... is Fighting Wind Requiem.”
(he poses as thunder crashes)
“You mocked resolve. You mocked truth. Now:
ORA ORA ORA ORA ORA ORAAAA!!!”

Regigigas is pounded back into a crater so deep it breaks through the bottom of the test field and hits the cinematic archive room beneath.

[Cut to silence.]

Regigigas (from the hole, quietly):
“…I regret 12% of everything.”

Lil Eve (peering in from above, deadpan):
“Progress.”

[Scene: Crater pit. Regigigas wheezes, twitching after the brutal elemental combo. Goo drips, feathers scatter, illusions fade.]

Lil Eve peers down, arms crossed, the poisoned mist parting around her.

Lil Eve (quietly, a little wistful):
“…The real Gengar and Machamp have been gone a long time.”

[She looks up at the sky where the stars seem to shimmer with echoes of old laughter and grunts.]

Lil Eve (softer):
“I still miss them sometimes…”

[Regigigas, still shivering, burbles through cracked stone and psychic burn marks:]

Regigigas:
“W-Who were they?! Ghosts?! Gods?! Punching nightmares?!”

Lil Eve (dry):
“Just friends. The kind that left echoes strong enough to slap sense into a titan.”

[She walks off. The crater hums as the past lets go, but not entirely.]

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

[Scene: The Nine Elemental Trials unfold across increasingly surreal domains, twisting the legacy of the original Eeveelution rites. Lil Eve supports from the shadows, while Keldeo forges his way, wielding the shifting sword bestowed by Ghostvee.]

=POISON TRIAL=
Toxic sludge pulses in concentric ripples. Keldeo begins coughing.
Lil Eve narrows her eyes and fires a Psybeam Focus, parting the miasma with psionic clarity.
She lifts him with gentle telekinesis over the bubbling pool.
Keldeo acquires: Poison Jab ,  the sword briefly glows virulent green, edges laced in venom.

=BUG TRIAL=
Puzzle-hives swarm with metallic cicada logic traps.
Lil Eve: “Nah.”
With a shrug, she incinerates the maze via Flamethrower Trail, leaving a scorched, clean path.
Keldeo earns: Bug Sting ,  a rapid, pinpoint jab mode.

=FLYING TRIAL=
A gauntlet of erratic drones and gust chambers.
Lil Eve: “Time to short-circuit.”
She zips through using Electro Drift, supercharging the drones to stabilize their erratic paths.
Keldeo receives: Dashing Upward Strike ,  optimized for aerial pursuit.

=FIGHTING TRIAL=
An octopus-shaped battle mech mimicking ancient martial styles.
Lil Eve blinds it with Dazzling Gleam, then locks limbs using Psybeam Focus.
Keldeo rushes in, parrying and striking in perfect form. Fightvee watches, nods, then yields.
Keldeo gains: Passive boost to fighting-type abilities + Knuckle Mode for the sword.

=GROUND TRIAL=
The subterranean garden rumbles violently.
Lil Eve wields Grassy Vines to root the terrain and Surfing Waterfall to irrigate, calming the quake.
Keldeo is rewarded: Ground Slam ,  sword can shift into a seismic anchor.

=ROCK TRIAL=
Crude boulder puzzles tower high.
Lil Eve beautifies the trial again, reshaping the area with Grassy Vines and Surfing Water, sculpting natural harmony.
Keldeo gains: Stone Edge Mode ,  juts of jagged stone spike from his strikes.

=STEEL TRIAL=
Giant spinning steel traps hover over molten platforms.
Lil Eve: “Unwinnable setup?”
She obliterates the hazard zones with Flamethrower Trail, melting traps to slag.
Keldeo makes it through. His sword morphs into Slash & Shield Mode.
He pauses, holding it with reverence.
Keldeo:
“…Reminds me of someone... Aegislash. Taught me form and stance. He was... sharp in every sense.”
Lil Eve nods solemnly.

=DRAGON TRIAL=
Chaos in the form of a cooking contest.
Lil Eve crafts frozen delicacies using Frost Print, then demands fairer judging with Dazzling Gleam.
Keldeo earns: Claw Mode ,  the blade now slashes with feral, serrated grace.

=GHOST TRIAL=
Ghostvee floats with smug confidence.
Lil Eve: Pulsive Foul Play
Ghostvee: KO’d instantly.
Trial auto-clears.
Keldeo gains: Dash Through Projectiles ,  brief intangibility step.

[Post-Trials, beneath the twin moons]
The sword now flickers through forms with ease.
Keldeo smiles, triumphant but mellow.

Keldeo (gently):
“…You made all of this… fun.”

Lil Eve (blushing faintly):
“You didn’t mind all the… excessive help?”

Keldeo:
“Not when the help is you.”

[He leans in and kisses her softly. She closes her eyes, hand resting over his heart. Their silhouettes glow gently under the cosmic night.]

Lil Eve (whispering):
“Another saga, huh?”

[The sword hums. Somewhere distant, stars shift.]

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

[Scene: Cosmic Atelier ,  Somewhere adrift in a quiet solar reef, surrounded by aurora storms and translucent space reefs. Inside a glass-laced observatory dome, Lil Eve and Keldeo sit together at a shimmering terminal shaped like an old arcade cabinet crossed with a star projector.]

Lil Eve (excited):
“Okay, so in EveX Kelzero, you play as us ,  duh ,  but like, rebooted.”

Keldeo (grinning, tweaking code):
“You get ranged tech attacks and I get melee slashes and sword styles. But we swap mid-battle when combo meter’s full.”

[A holographic sprite of EveX dashes across a retro cyber-nebula. Kelzero bursts onto the screen in blazing entrance slash, both characters now digitized with fluid pixel-perfect flair.]

-

[Meanwhile: In the same observatory’s testing chamber ,  neon-slick, low-grav chamber lit by floating screens and AI commentators ,  their two kids, Cosmician Rapidash and Galaxian Gastrier, are locked in joyful combat with digital enemies.]

Cosmician Rapidash (voice blazing, holding the retro-styled controller in flames):
“Dad’s sword combo is broken… I love it.”
He triggers an overheat slash, screen flashes red.

Galaxian Gastrier (calm and giggling, controller glowing in psychic hue):
“Mom’s tech spam is cheating, but I like the hover jump.”
She triggers a psychic wave while floating midair, evading beautifully.

-

[Back at the dev terminal.]

Keldeo (glancing proudly at the test feed):
“They’re better than we were at that age.”

Lil Eve (playfully smug):
“Correction: they’re better than you were. I always carried the team.”

Keldeo:
“Oh really now? Rematch, dev-side debug tools only?”

Lil Eve:
“You’re on.”

[The camera pans out. Stars swirl. A faint silhouette of Megaman X and Zero is briefly seen reflected on the glass, fading into EveX and Kelzero.]

[Title splash appears: “EveX Kelzero: Beyond Data & Soul”]

Cosmician & Galaxian (cheering in unison):
“MAKE THE DLC!”

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

[Scene: Ghostvee’s Boss Rush Hall, an ever-shifting arena lined with elemental banners, gleaming crystals, and runes pulsing with eerie light. 
No Normal or Ghost types appear, by design. Each combatant faces their legacy.]

-

Lil Eve’s Path – The Original 8
1. Flareon Illusion
Her father’s fiery echo. The moment the illusion roars, Lil Eve responds with Surfing Waterfall, extinguishing it with a wave of graceful instinct, a symbolic nod to her inherited elemental balance.

2. Jolteon Illusion
An old school friend of her parents. The speed nearly overwhelms her. She channels Psybeam Focus, causing terrain disruption, not enough to win easily, but enough to break the rhythm. She improvises, and learns.

3. Vaporeon Illusion
Her mother’s soft yet fluid echo. Lil Eve counters with Grassy Vines and Electro Drift, barely holding momentum as the battlefield keeps shifting. She wins, drenched but smiling.

4. Espeon Illusion
Her paternal grandmother’s measured presence. She unleashes Pulsive Foul Play, raw, dark and precise, dissolving the illusion with surprising ease.

5. Umbreon Illusion
The harsh stern energy of her paternal grandfather. Dazzling Gleam lights up the shadowed hall. The dimly lit battle forces her to focus, she perseveres through the murk.

6. Leafeon Illusion
An elderly projection of her maternal grandfather. She combines Flamethrower Trial and Frost Print, destabilizing temperature and throwing the illusion off balance, a blend of burning fire and crystalline control.

7. Glaceon Illusion
Her maternal grandmother’s cold projection. Melted away by Flamethrower Trial, Lil Eve does not flinch as she clears the ice with respect.

8. Sylveon Illusion
The most unpredictable, her former teacher’s echo. Resistant to direct counters. Lil Eve uses the arena itself: redirects poison pools with Psybeam Focus, and attracts steel arms with Electro Drift, letting the environment assist. She stands victorious… just barely.

-

Keldeo’s Path – The New 8
1. Bugvee Illusion
Crushed swiftly with Dashing Upward Strike and Stone Edge Mode. He moves fast, no hesitation.

2. Dragonvee Illusion
A raw duel of draconic forces, Claw Mode versus Claw. Blow for blow, he wins with sheer agility and experience.

3. Rockvee Illusion
Using Ground Slam to shatter the battlefield, and switching to Knuckle Mode and Slash & Shield Mode for defense. Tactical victory.

4. Groundvee Illusion
Toughest for him. No elemental edge. He improvises with weaker water-based techniques. Grit and tenacity get him through.

5. Poisonvee Illusion
Handled swiftly with Ground Slam, shaking the arena under toxic fields.

6. Flyvee Illusion
High-altitude battle. Stone Edge Mode intercepts from below, Keldeo times his strikes with sharp precision.

7. Fightvee Illusion
A brutal test. His own skills are mirrored. Dashing Upward Strike proves essential for interrupting Fightvee’s aerial barrages.

8. Steelvee Illusion
The wildest. Slamming down with Ground Slam, then switching mid-combo to Knuckle Mode for close quarters, he finishes with sheer brute force.

-

[Finale: Reunion Hall]

[Lil Eve walks into the lighted exit corridor, where her parents Vaporeon and Flareon await, both real. Without a word, she hugs them both, a calm, nostalgic grin on her face.]

Lil Eve:
“Sorry for the wham. They weren’t you… but still.”

Vaporeon (smiling):
“They were us, once. But we raised you for this.”

Flareon (laughing):
“Besides, you really smoked my illusion. Oof.”

[Behind them, a crystal display shows the whole montage, broadcasted sneakily by Ghostvee. The parents watched every second.]

-

[Keldeo arrives just as Lil Eve finishes her hug.]

Keldeo (wiping forehead):
“That… was something.”

Lil Eve (smirking):
“I know.”
She pulls him in for a kiss.

-

Final Chamber – The Regigigas Illusion
A massive chamber filled with suspended gravity and floating ruins. The illusion roars.

Keldeo (cracking knuckles):
“Let’s finish it.”

[He activates Knuckle Mode and rushes in, slamming the illusion Regigigas with a blow charged with all his trial-earned powers.]

[However… far away… the real Regigigas, who was watching through the Death Loop Tablet, suddenly twitches. He feels it.]

Regigigas (distant voiceover):
“WAIT NO, AAARGH NOT AGAIN!”

[He's slammed into molten metal, slammed by bugs, spooked by ghosts, and now gut-punched from another dimension. The poor titan flips over, face-first into steel goo.]

-

Lil Eve (watching the illusion fall):
“...Did that feel a bit too real?”

Keldeo (nervously):
“...We might need to check on the real one.”

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

[Scene: Somewhere nearby, a pristine snowy ledge overlooking the Boss Rush arena’s aftermath.]

Alolan Ninetales (lounging dramatically on a floating glacier platform):
“Two. Billion. Years. That’s how long it took to bring the tone back to something resembling the first saga's goofy energy.”

[She looks directly at the screen. 4th wall breaking.]

Alolan Ninetales:
“I mean, remember when Lil Eve was just trying to figure out how to slap with Dazzling Gleam without vaporizing the floor? Now we got ghost trials, death mirrors, and reality-splitting swords. Somebody had to say it.”

[Gardevoir walks in through a sparkle-teleport, folding her arms.]

Gardevoir:
“It’s not our fault the tone dipped. Everything went downhill when Ceruledge showed up with that edge-core monologue and, oh, right, killed Jolteon and Zoroark.”

Alolan Ninetales:
“Yeah. That arc was all smoke, swords, and soul trauma. Pure trauma spice. I swear the only jokes back then were… well, none.”

[Cut to Vaporeon and Flareon, quietly sitting nearby with hot cocoa in their paws.]

Vaporeon (staring into the mug):
“That… actually still gets to me. But...”

Flareon (gently patting her back):
“...we’ve moved forward. It doesn’t hurt as bad anymore.”

[Vaporeon nods quietly, holding the warmth close.]

-

[Meanwhile, Lil Eve and Keldeo are just a bit further away, examining the aftermath of the Regigigas incident.]

Keldeo (looking back):
“…Was that Alolan Ninetales talking to the wall?”

Lil Eve:
“She’s probably just rebooting the comedic meta-thread.”

Keldeo:
“Should we be worried?”

Lil Eve:
“…Nah. Let her cook. We earned a breather.”

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

[Scene: Inside Ghostvee’s completed Boss Rush Archive. The Immortal Six sit before a screen projecting curated tapes, memories and records of centuries past.]

[Footage: Tinkaton's divine gavel crushes a torn Darkrai into a 200-year dream sentence, sped into 1 real-life month. Cut to: Tinkaton lying beside her husband Tyranitar, both silently haunted, no revealed dialogues, only shown regretful gazes.]

-

Gardevoir (stoic, but voice tinged with memory):
“…That was the turning point. When Ceruledge killed Jolteon and Zoroark, the tone of our journey changed. The comedy left. Everything became real.”

Alolan Ninetales (half-grin, half-grimace):
“And it took two billion years to finally get that comedy back. Just a moment of levity, a touch of absurdity again.”

Flareon (quiet, eyes shadowed):
“They weren’t family, but they were friends. Jolteon had a spark that outlived his own lightning. Zoroark… made illusions feel honest. Ho-Oh brought them back… only to die much later. We all saw it.”

Vaporeon (calm, but heavy):
“Ho-Oh used his miracle to bring them back in Saga 2. And he fell with final revival during Regigigas' rampage in Saga 4. He gave us time… but not eternity.”

Lil Eve (nostalgic):
“I remember Jolteon. His pranks made me snort-leaf out of my ears. Zoroark told me illusions are just stories in motion… I loved that.”

Keldeo (smiles wistfully):
“Jolteon zapped my water spells for fun. Zoroark made me look ten years older just to sneak me into a movie once. I never forgot them.”

-

[Screen glitches. Regigigas appears, spectral and sour, still locked in the Death Loop Tablet.]

Regigigas (deadpan):
“Oh great. Flashback theatre again. Meanwhile I’m getting Arceus-lasered every hour and watching fake Mew perform interpretive dance death moves.”

Gardevoir (dry):
“You earned it. We're all here because you survived... and because you broke so much first.”

Alolan Ninetales (flicking tail):
“There are seven of us. You included. Two billion years... we lived it together. Don't act like we forgot.”

Regigigas (grumbling):
“Yeah? Then why am I the one watching fake Machamp whisper ‘Fighting Wind Requiem’ before punching my soul into a spreadsheet?”

Flareon (gruff):
“Because Ho-Oh died cleaning up your mess. And that debt’s still unpaid.”

Vaporeon (firmly):
“You did save us in the end. We took on the immortality burden so the world wouldn’t fracture again. But salvation doesn’t erase destruction.”

Lil Eve (grinning):
“By the way, we added you as the first boss in EveX Kelzero. You’re the tutorial punching bag.”

Keldeo (elbowing the air):
“Knuckle Mode says hi. We even gave you comically large hitboxes.”

-

Regigigas (groaning as a Machamp illusion reloads in the background):
“Great. Two billion years later, I’m downgraded to comic relief. Mewtwo had it easy. He just left.”

[Off-screen: Illusion Machamp loads again.]

“This is… Fighting Wind Requiem. You will never reach the truth…”

-

[The screen fades. Silence falls.]

Gardevoir (softly):
“…Ho-Oh believed in rebirth even after ruin. His fire may be gone, but he lives in every act of defiance against despair.”

Alolan Ninetales (eyes closed):
“We miss him more than we admit. But we live... because he chose to fall instead of letting us.”

Lil Eve (quiet smile):
“Then we keep moving. Light steps forward, even if the shadows follow.”

Keldeo (stretching):
“That’s all that matters. Now… time to go prank Regigigas with a new debug patch.”

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

[Scene resumes in the ancient echoing halls of Ghostvee’s Boss Rush Archive. The screen now dims, fading from Tinkaton's verdict footage. A new tape quietly ends. A single image lingers, Ho-Oh’s final recorded still: wings ablaze, casting radiant light across a devastated battlefield.]

[Silent reverence holds the room.]

Alolan Ninetales (lowering head):
“…Thank you, Ho-Oh. For bringing Mamoswine back… even if only for one more winter.”

Gardevoir (bowed posture, voice calm):
“You returned Lucario to me… long enough to say goodbye the right way. I am grateful.”

Flareon (hushed, nodding):
“You saved our daughter.”

Vaporeon (softly):
“And gave her the future she never would've had… with Keldeo by her side.”

-

[Lil Eve and Keldeo stand quietly at the back, both solemn.]

Lil Eve (reflecting):
“…We died, didn’t we? That first stone slam.”

Keldeo (nodding, quiet):
“All five of us. Regigigas went out of control. Ho-Oh… brought us all back. Us two… Tyranitar, Lucario, Mamoswine…”

Lil Eve:
“And paid for it with himself. Too old, too tired. But still chose us.”

[The screen flickers to the Death Loop Tablet. Regigigas is seen getting stone slammed repeatedly, this time by his own illusion within the loop. A glowing counter hovers above his head: “Karmic Repayment Remaining: 2,096,434,269 years.”]

Keldeo (deadpan):
“Well, he’s still busy. We got time.”

Lil Eve (smirking):
“Let’s go. EveX Kelzero isn’t gonna code itself.”

-

[Later: inside Lil Eve and Keldeo’s cozy dev chamber. The two are at a pixel art desk. Lil Eve adjusts a sprite: Regigigas, oversized and ridiculous, mid-explosion.]

Keldeo:
“So… he’s the first boss and the final boss?”

Lil Eve:
“Exactly. Classic Sigma. Tutorial dummy who comes back with cosmic vengeance.”

Keldeo:
“Still easier than fighting Machamp’s Requiem spam.”

Lil Eve:
“And ten times more dramatic.”

-

[Back in the tablet loop, Regigigas lays face-down, smoking after a dramatic combo from his own illusion.]

Regigigas (groaning):
“I wish Ho-Oh would just finish me off already. Be poetic. Full circle, right?”

[Suddenly, a random flaming phoenix swoops in from the sky, screeches, and vaporizes Regigigas in one fiery slam.]

Regigigas (voice from offscreen):
“…That wasn’t even Ho-Oh. Who the hell was that?!”

[Text flashes: “Respawning in 7 minutes… 2,096,434,268.986 years remaining.”]

Regigigas (distantly):
“Kill me slower next time, you off-brand turkey!”

-

[End scene. The camera pans upward as soft light glows from the flashback image of Ho-Oh, forever suspended in glory. The six immortals, and one bound titan, continue on their paths, stories eternal.]

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

[Scene opens in a cozy glowing dev room, cluttered with retro monitors, snack wrappers, and sketches pinned to the wall. A large stylized poster reads: EveX Kelzero — Beta Test Begins!]

[Lil Eve sits in her usual seifuku, now sporting large oval glasses that slightly slide down her nose as she types. Her expression is calm, laser-focused. Her long ears twitch with each keystroke. A mug labeled “debug me gently” sits by her keyboard.]

Keldeo (in gakuran, leaning against her chair, arms crossed):
“…You know, you look insanely cute with those glasses.”

Lil Eve (adjusts glasses, without looking up):
“Thanks.”
[She glances up with a smirk. Her tone dips to velvet.]
“Wanna test more than just the game?”

Keldeo (blinks, then grins):
“You’re not subtle anymore.”

[Without hesitation, he scoops her up in a smooth bridal carry. Her glasses jostle slightly, but she laughs softly.]

Lil Eve (resting her head on his shoulder):
“You’re warm.”
[She kisses him on the cheek.]

Keldeo:
“Your glasses are… soft. They’re touching my face weirdly. I like it.”

-

[They return to work — Lil Eve now coding with one hand while sitting cross-legged in Keldeo’s lap, Keldeo sketching animations of sprite enemies with his pencil stylus.]

[A monitor displays a test level: pixel Lil Eve in magical attire firing Psybeam arcs while Keldeo slashes glowing hex-bugs with Knuckle Mode.]

Lil Eve (softly):
“…This is the kind of story I used to daydream about. Nerdy magical girl saves the world with a soft but strong boyfriend.”

Keldeo (smirking, still sketching):
“Plot twist: you’re both the magical girl and the boss fight. I’m just the sword.”

Lil Eve (giggles):
“You’re the whole combat system, dummy.”

[A message pings on the side monitor: Cosmician Rapidash and Galaxian Gastrier have logged in to playtest. Their kids are online. The screen splits to show them excitedly button mashing in their cozy room.]

Cosmician (male Fire/Dark):
“Can I play as Dad? I wanna punch that fake Regigigas boss again!”

Galaxian (female Water/Psychic):
“Mom has like… ten movement options. This is so unfair.”

[Lil Eve and Keldeo glance at each other.]

Keldeo:
“They grow up so fast.”

Lil Eve:
“Let’s make sure they never outscore us.”

[They fist bump, the screen flashing as the beta test begins in earnest.]

-

[Final shot: Regigigas’ sprite appears on screen, with the words “FINAL BOSS — VERSION BETA 0.01.” A debugging textbox on the side reads: “Regigigas AI: broken (again). Respawn loop enabled.”]

Regigigas (voice from tablet background):
“Stop coding me to suffer!”

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

[Scene: EveX Kelzero - In-Game Stage 3: “Labyrinth of Lost Signals”]

[Player 1: Cosmician Rapidash – Fire/Dark hybrid armor, red flame trail as he dashes, gauntlet-based melee. Moveset: Dash Burst, Flame Spin, Shadow Jab]
[Player 2: Galaxian Gastrier – Water/Psychic themed dress, levitating idle stance, glowing eyes. Moveset: Wave Cannon, Mind Pull, Reflect Bubble]

[HUD reads: CO-OP MODE – Team: LilKnight and PrismSiren]

Cosmician (via voice chat):
“You got the left corridor, sis? Bet I finish my half faster.”

Galaxian (coolly):
“Bet you die to the first laser crab like always.”

[Split screen: Cosmician zips forward through flame pillars, lands a perfect combo on glitching bugbots. Galaxian calmly levitates past a spike maze, disables traps with psychic pulses.]

Cosmician (punching corrupted Regigigas mini-bot):
“This guy again?! Mom and Dad love putting him everywhere.”

Galaxian (sighs as she Reflect Bubbles a second one into a wall):
“Mom coded it. Dad kept designing new helmets for him. You know how they are.”

-

[Cutscene Trigger: Double boss fight — Holo Illusion of “Sigma Gigas Beta” appears, splits into two clones mid-battle. Music kicks up in glitchy techno rock.]

Cosmician:
“Call it: I punch mine, you psychic nuke yours?”

Galaxian:
“Try not to get uppercutted into space again.”

[Cosmician uses Shadow Jab into Flame Spin, bouncing between walls like a pinball. Galaxian charges Wave Cannon while floating in reverse gravity, spirals her attack through shifting portals.]

[Double KO lands at same time. Game slows to cinematic slow-mo finish with pixel confetti. Text pops up: “Sibling Sync Bonus Achieved!”]

-

[Scene shifts to in-game reward room: pixel chibis of Lil Eve and Keldeo wave at them, giving each a badge: “Beta Explorers”]

Cosmician (grinning IRL):
“Yo… we crushed it. You think Dad saw that?”

Galaxian:
“Definitely. He’s probably sketching a boss version of us already.”

[Back in dev room: Lil Eve and Keldeo watching proudly from debug monitor, sharing instant ramen and giggling at the kids’ banter.]

Lil Eve:
“They’re stronger than we were.”

Keldeo:
“…but just chaotic enough to be ours.”

Lil Eve (smiles with soft tone):
“Think they’ll carry the game if we ever... need to stop?”

Keldeo (without hesitation):
“Nope. They’ll evolve it.”

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

[Flashback Tape: Title – “The Day the Two Were Born”]
Presented in soft faded colors, lined with gentle ambient harp and strings.

[Scene: Umbreon’s Hospital – Moonlight Pediatrics, 2 billion years ago]
Umbreon (in white doctor’s coat and glasses) gently holds a newborn Keldeo, freshly wrapped in blue blankets. His voice is calm but firm.

Umbreon:
“Healthy. Sturdy build. But he won't carry Mythical blood—his structure’s based on the form, not the lineage.”

[Next to him, Espeon flips through a glowing book titled ‘Divinity, DNA, and Heritage.’ She adjusts her crescent glasses.]

Espeon:
“His mother’s a mortal. A Galarian Rapidash, no divine link. And Gastrier, the father… pure Ice-type, but fully mortal, and properly male. It's not a bad thing, but sensitive.”

[In the recovery bed, Galarian Rapidash looks tired but smiles.]

Galarian Rapidash:
“…Can I… Can I see Umbreon’s granddaughter? I heard she was just born days ago…”

[Umbreon nods, leaving momentarily and returning with a very small newborn Lil Eve, swaddled in lavender cloth with star prints. Their tiny forms face each other on the bed’s edge.]

[The infants reach with barely-coordinated hooves and paws. They touch gently. The room is silent, reverent.]

Umbreon (quietly, observing):
“…We still need to ensure Lil Eve gets proper feeding from her mother.”

[The door opens—Vaporeon, in maternity school uniform, walks in, looking warm and radiant despite visible tiredness.]

Vaporeon:
“There you are, my little star.”

[She kneels beside the bed, takes Lil Eve into her arms, and nurses her gently while humming. Galarian Rapidash watches with calm joy. Moments later, Flareon enters, wearing his schoolboy uniform with his badge tilted.]

Flareon:
“…She looks just like you.”

[He leans in to gently kiss Vaporeon’s cheek as she cradles Lil Eve. The family moment is warm, quiet.]

[Once they leave, Galarian Rapidash calls softly.]

Galarian Rapidash:
“…Aegislash?”

[The loyal ghost-steel knight floats in silently through the corridor, saluting.]

Aegislash:
“…You called.”

Galarian Rapidash:
“This foal will grow up as more than just a colt. When his time comes… train him.”

Aegislash:
“I swear it upon my blade. He shall become a knight worth the honor.”

-

[Back to present: EveX Kelzero HQ – cozy couch corner]
The room is warm-lit. Retro console sounds hum in the background. Outside, virtual auroras shimmer on the debug monitors.

[Vaporeon (still in her forever-maid outfit) has Flareon (in his tidy butler attire) peacefully napping on her lap. She bridal-carries him while humming a slow tune, stroking his fur with her tail as he sleeps.]

[Lil Eve and Keldeo are seated nearby on a couch, hand-in-hand, fingers interlaced more tightly than usual. A hint of warmth on their cheeks. Keldeo stares into the soft lights, pensive.]

Keldeo (softly):
“…I didn’t know they brought us together that early.”

Lil Eve:
“I didn’t either. But maybe we remembered. Somehow.”

[Vaporeon looks up from Flareon to the young couple. Her voice is dreamy but heartfelt.]

Vaporeon:
“You two were adorable even then… just small and sleepy little things. Now look at you… lovers, creators, warriors… immortals.”

[Flareon stirs slightly in her arms, but stays sleeping. Vaporeon kisses his forehead.]

Vaporeon (whispering):
“…Thank you… for giving her to me.”

[Scene fades gently to the soft glow of the debug monitor—"EveX Kelzero – Beta Patch Ready."]
