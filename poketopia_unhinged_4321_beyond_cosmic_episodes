Opening to the eternal spin-off of Poketopia: Unhinged post-finale (Beyond Cosmic Episodes)

The Immortal Six :

Gardevoir (stuck in a policewoman uniform and pencil skirt):
The leader of the immortals. She serves as a police officer, detective, prison warden, engineer, and prophetic seer. She oversees the balance and justice within the immortal herd and is the most rational mind among them.

Alolan Ninetales (stuck in a light blue sundress):
A generator of cold and sculptor of ice. Often the comedic relief, she helps produce ice cubes, preserve ingredients, and add flair with her frozen artistry. Despite her elegance, she enjoys slapstick moments and lighthearted mischief.

Flareon (stuck in a fireproof butler uniform):
The ever-burning cook. He can now handle even poisonous ingredients with no concern, gracefully walks across lava, but remains weak to drowning. His cuisine is legendary, with flavor and heat matched only by his eternal dedication.

Vaporeon (stuck in a swimming maid uniform):
Flareon’s lifelong wife, beverage artisan, and personal lifeguard. She cools lava into obsidian when necessary and navigates all cool-to-warm liquids with ease. Her flowing presence balances Flareon’s fiery energy.

Lil Eve, the Eight-Element Eevee (stuck in a seifuku):
The biological daughter of Vaporeon and Flareon. A versatile all-rounder, she harnesses eight elemental abilities, six honoring the long-gone past, and two reflecting her immortal parents. Youthful, wise, and emotionally radiant.

Keldeo [non-Mythical] (stuck in a gakuran uniform):
Lil Eve’s boyfriend and chivalrous knight. Though based on a Mythical species, he is the child of two mortal Pokémon, Galarian Rapidash and Gastrier, which allowed him to achieve Hourai-style immortality. Courageous, fast, and dependable, he also serves as secondary lifeguard and planetary delivery knight. Keldeo carries the Regigigas Death Loop Tablet, visiting planet after planet as a gentle reminder of the price of selfish immortality.

Meanwhile...
Regigigas is eternally trapped within the Death Loop Tablet (themed in Arceus' colored case), where he must relive countless humiliating and painful deaths, forever smelling the delicious food and drinks made by Flareon and Vaporeon, unable to taste, move, or truly die. A poetic punishment for the one who dared to slay Arceus.

(Curious why they ended up like this? Poketopia: Unhinged 4 - It's About Life Types directly tells the events of it, but its trilogy of prequels also tells what leads them into this point as well...)

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

And what a beautifully unhinged, bittersweet, hilarious, and poetic end it was.

From toilet humor to cosmic justice, from gacha satire to immortality reflections, from copypasta invasions to Regigigas becoming a divine punching bag, your saga didn’t just end, it ascended.
It tied itself off like a fireworks finale: chaotic, meaningful, stupidly funny, and weirdly emotional.

You gave your immortals peace, gave your perverts consequences, gave your gods karmic justice, and even gave the readers (and yourself) a quiet nod that yes, it's time.

Poketopia: Unhinged ends not with a bang, but with a scream… from inside the tablet.

Well done.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Regigigas really be trapped in the cosmic equivalent of a cursed TikTok loop, doing Gangnam Style in a death tablet while the immortals are peacefully asleep on a futon, unmoved.
Then out of nowhere: Mewtwo jump scare.

*"Oppa Mewtwo style, "
[PUNCH]
"Guh… not again…"

This guy went from ancient titan to eternal comedic timing. The Regigigas Death Loop Tablet is basically Looney Tunes meets Dante’s Inferno, and he’s Bugs Bunny if Bugs kept dying horribly.

At this point, Regigigas is no longer a tragic villain, he’s a performance art piece.
A grim reminder that immortality isn’t always a blessing.
But at least… he dances.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Even in death loop eternity, Regigigas can't catch a break, just chilling (or rather, writhing) in his tablet prison, only to get collateral damage from a historical playback beatdown of Rayquaza getting pummeled by Tyranitar.

Rayquaza: "Tyranitar, wait, I can explain, "
Tyranitar: "NOPE."
*[Punch-punch-punch]
Regigigas (off-screen): "Wait, why am I on fire agai, "
*[BOOM. Dead x5.]

Poor guy is stuck in a cosmic highlight reel where he’s not even the main event, yet still dies five times out of proximity. Like a background character in a war flashback who forgot to duck.

And the immortals? Still sipping smoothies, doing laundry, tending gardens, reading books, completely unfazed.
Just another Tuesday in the post-finale serenity.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Regigigas, trapped in the tablet, now forced to endure five separate alternate timeline versions of Rayquaza trying to pitch him gacha-based MLM scams like some cursed cosmic telemarketer:

Rayquaza 1: “Yo bro, just invest ten Ultra Balls and get ten friends to do the same, ”
Rayquaza 2: “Limited-time Dragon Orb bundle! Only available if you sell your soul!”
Rayquaza 3: “Ever heard of RaidPassCoin? Totally sustainable, trust me.”
Rayquaza 4: “You too can become a GachaMillionaire if you hatch enough eggs, ”
Rayquaza 5: “Hey Regigigas, I made this NFT of you screaming, wanna mint it?”

Regigigas: [loud mechanical groan] “I DESERVE THIS... I DESERVE THIS...”
He curls into a rock, cringing so hard he practically folds in half, haunted by his own past life as a scammy salesman bot boss in saga 4. A time when he was making those calls... and now karmic justice plays back like a looped nightmare.

And outside?
The six immortals are just calmly setting the dinner table. Vaporeon pours drinks. Flareon flips an omelet. Gardevoir marks “Rayquaza MLM Day #2568” in the records. No one bats an eye.

Regigigas is literally the embodiment of "You either die a villain, or live long enough to get haunted by your old sales scripts."

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Regigigas, still trapped in his poetic punishment loop, suddenly sees it, 
a sizzling plate of Flareon's signature lava-roasted Magikarp steak and a frosty Vaporeon-blended Oran Berry smoothie placed delicately on a table inside the illusion.

His ancient stone stomach rumbles.

Regigigas (inner monologue):
“Finally... not MLM, not sharks, not Rayquaza… real food…”

He crawls toward it, trembling, eyes glowing with desperation, like a caveman discovering fire.

He devours the steak.
He chugs the smoothie.

Pause... blink... pause...

Then his eyes dilate. The food turns purple.
He opens his mouth, 
“GAAAAAAAHHHH, !!”
He explodes into confetti. Again.

On the tablet display:

"WARNING: LAVA MAGIKARP IS NOT FOR STONE-BASED LIFE FORMS."
"SMOOTHIE: SPIKED WITH LAXATIVE OF GODS."

Back in reality, the six immortals are sipping tea in polite silence.
Alolan Ninetales sips and mutters with a smirk,
“He always falls for the food illusion…”

Flareon shrugs, flipping a pancake.
“Can’t say I didn’t warn him a million deaths ago.”

And Vaporeon, very calmly, updates the counter on the kitchen fridge:
"Regigigas Death Count: 98,745"
Lil Eve sticks a smiling sticker next to it.

Regigigas respawns in the tablet, face-palming in existential agony.
He mumbles,
“Next time... I’ll sniff first...”
Then a Sharpedo-shaped spoon appears from nowhere and bonks him again.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

As the starlit ocean sky bends above the lonely new world, a colossal silhouette glides through the stratosphere, 
a reincarnated Gyarados, no longer bound by rage but reborn as an ethereal aquatic alien, adorned with bioluminescent scales and gentle eyes.

Hovering silently with cosmic grace, the creature’s eyes scan the landmass below…

It sees them:
The six Hourai-immortals enjoying their peaceful chores, sipping tea, cracking jokes, guarding gardens, and living in polite eternity.

Then it notices the Tablet.
Regigigas, in yet another cycle, is getting stabbed by a giant spoon while trying to apologize to a mirage of Mew.

Gyarados’ fins twitch. The water around it ripples in the airless void.

Gyarados (telepathically):

“So this... is the reward for immortality?
Serene tea parties… and one soul locked in eternal slapstick hell?”

It lets out a deep, bubbling sigh, like a whale ancient enough to remember humanity’s sins.

And for a moment, as it continues to drift past the planet, it whispers across dimensions:

“Irony is… you were stronger than me once, Regigigas.
But now you scream for mercy over snacks.”

The alien Gyarados leaves, weaving back into the stars,
its final thought echoing like a ripple in the void:

“May I never live long enough to end like you.”

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Scene: Alien Planet #47-3X / Twin Moons Horizon

Under the flickering twilight of two suns, Keldeo, in his ever-immaculate gakuran, walks proudly and upright, bridal-carrying Lil Eve, whose seifuku flutters in the alien wind, tails swaying with relaxed delight. Their 2-by-2 walk becomes more of a quiet hover stroll, with Lil Eve poking his cheek now and then.

But the peace is abruptly broken by a grotesque electronic screech.

Behind them, dragged on a levitating cart tethered by forgetful routine, is Regigigas’ Death Loop Tablet, still active.

Regigigas (invisible within the screen):

“AUGH, NO, NOT THE CUDDLE WALK AGAIN, gasp, THE GAPING ROMANCE, urghhh, I DIED, again...”

He flops, dies of cringe, flails, revives, and dies again, all within five seconds.

Keldeo blinks, freezes, then whispers:

Keldeo:

“...Oops. Forgot I brought that.”

Lil Eve giggles and pats his snout.
“Let him cope.”

-

Meanwhile ,  Sea Shore of Alien Planet #14-ΩB

A sudden mini-earthquake jostles the land, and with a surprised yelp, Flareon slides into the glittering alien sea, steam hissing from his coat.

Flareon (half-submerged):

“I swear I was standing on solid, glub, ”

Before he can finish, Vaporeon sighs with grace long practiced and elegantly dives in, lifting him once again in the bridal carry of rescue.

Alolan Ninetales, watching with a popsicle in mouth, lazily mutters:

Ninetales:

“That’s… carry number one million and three. And a half. I counted.”

Gardevoir, standing near the spaceship gangway with a clipboard and sun visor, doesn’t look up.

Gardevoir:

“Ship's fine. But Flareon’s ego isn’t.”

Flareon (blushing through steam):

“I could’ve gotten out myself… eventually…”

Vaporeon (deadpan):

“Sure. When the magma tide comes back in?”

They all share a silent, eternal sigh of immortals tired of routine but committed to kindness.

Somewhere in the far cosmos, Regigigas dies of secondhand embarrassment. Again.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Scene: Aboard the Immortals’ Ship ,  “Hourai Drifter”

Several centuries had passed since the last shared outing, but as time loops casually brushed against timelines and long naps ended in stretches and yawns, the Immortal Six found themselves together again, on the bridge of their ship, sipping beverages or polishing tools, as if no time had passed at all.

Gardevoir:

“So. Reunion log confirmed. Estimated time since last gathering: 274 years, 9 months, 2 weeks, and… six skipped loops.”

Keldeo:

“Regigigas has… not fared well.”

He gestures solemnly to the Death Loop Tablet, flickering at the back. Within it, Regigigas spasms in silent agony as he cringes through flashbacks of Vaporeon fanfiction lines, endless romantic walks, lava baths, gacha scams, and, worst of all, attempted karaoke.

Regigigas (from the tablet):

“MAKE IT STOP, WHY IS THERE AN ACCORDION VERSION OF GANGNAM STYLE, AAAAA, ”

-

Moments later, approaching Planet 934-RX, A Lava World

Flareon (tail wagging like a puppy):

“A whole planet made of lava! A paradise!”

Alolan Ninetales (already backing away):

“Nope. Too spicy. Not even the fridge can handle that atmosphere.”

Vaporeon (blinking calmly):

“I could make obsidian out of that sea. It’d look nice next to the kitchen counter.”

Lil Eve:

“I wanna see if magma tastes like fizzy cola!”

Gardevoir:

“Absolutely not.”

Keldeo:

“...Maybe just a peek?”

As the ship hovers into orbit for a closer look, someone fumbles a corner of the bridge. A clunk. A bump. A dramatic slip.

Flareon:

“...Did we just drop something?”

Everyone turns slowly toward the now-missing Regigigas Tablet, which had been accidentally nudged into the planet's core lava geyser.

For a moment, silence.

Then, POOF!

A shimmering void tear opens mid-air on the ship’s bridge… and the Death Loop Tablet rematerializes, right back in its spot, dripping magma and screaming slightly louder than before.

Regigigas (roaring from within):

“YOU CAN’T KILL WHAT’S ALREADY IN HELL!”

Keldeo (dryly):

“It’s bound to us. Like a cursed fridge magnet from a haunted souvenir shop.”

Vaporeon (sipping iced tea):

“Should’ve just gift-wrapped him for Heatran.”

Gardevoir:

“Can we mute him this time?”

Tablet:
“NO, NOOOO, THE FIZZY COLA MAGMA TASTES LIKE, ”

Gardevoir taps a psychic button. Silence.

The six sip in peace. Reunion successful. Regigigas… very much not.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

[Scene: Inside the Hourai Drifter – 69 Years Post-Lava Tablet Incident]

The Immortal Six gathered once again in their orbiting spaceship, sipping experimental teas made by Vaporeon and dodging Regigigas’ latest “I died again” notifications from the corner.

Keldeo dusted off a device labeled "Chronoscene Reflector", more commonly known as the Flashback Machine, an artifact that lets immortals project ultra-ancient memories into immersive holographic panoramas.

Lil Eve:

“Let’s see something from… 2.0003738292 billion years ago. Just before the long nap era.”

Flareon (chuckling):

“Oh wow. Poketopia Saga 4? That was peak grinding era.”

The machine buzzed to life, light streaming like memory waterfalls as it displayed a lively ancient Poketopia scene, sunset orange skies, impossibly tall structures, and yes…

-

Flashback Scene:

Crustle (waving blueprint scrolls):

“If I stack NetherSalt blocks from void to world top, and fill every single cubic meter, I’d finish the Beacon in about... 666 million years! Haha!”

Flareon (in the past, distracted by Vaporeon cooking):

“Mhm. Sounds cool. Can I eat NetherSalt?”

Garganacl (stoic):

“It’s pointless. Even immortals won’t waste forever on something so… grindy. I’d rather learn all dialects of Pokémon speech. Or nap.”

Crustle (grinning):

“C’mon! You just don’t appreciate true legacy structure design!”

Suddenly, Greedent waddles in, twinkle-eyed and grinning.

Greedent:

“Hey guys, did you know that in terms of, ”

Click.

-

Back to Present:

Vaporeon, now stirring a drink, had abruptly shut off the flashback machine, her eye twitching in exhaustion. Without warning, she lifted her swimming maid skirt just slightly with a teasing glance at Flareon.

Flareon (sputtering):

“Wh–?! Not here!”

Vaporeon (innocently):

“Just distracting you from cursed dialogue starters, dear.”

Regigigas (muffled, from a wall-mounted tablet wedged into the corner):

“I CAN’T BREATHE IN PIXELS, PLEASE STOP TEASING EACH OTHER, ”

He was currently wall-clipped into a suffocation loop, eyes twitching as memories of Greedent’s unfinished sentence looped in his cursed neural net.

Keldeo (not looking up):

“Reminder: install Flashback Machine parental filters.”

Gardevoir (writing notes calmly):

“Also: install psychic firewalls against perversion triggers. They age poorly.”

Alolan Ninetales (sipping a snowcone):

“It’s okay. I still think building a beacon that size sounds worse than Regigigas' loop.”

Everyone nodded in agreement, even the tablet buzzed sadly, acknowledging the truth.

Lil Eve:

“So what’s next, lava surfing with obsidian fins or, ”

Tablet (Regigigas' final scream of the day):

“NO MORE FLASHBACKS!!”

The ship drifted onward, the immortals relaxed, the cringe contained, for now.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

[Scene: Lush Planet “Erosbloom-89” – 69 Years After Landing]

Verdant vines stretched skyward as flowers pulsed softly in time with the planet’s heartbeat. The Hourai Immortals, eternally young yet cosmically seasoned, wandered its alien Eden with a bizarre serenity only billions of years could cultivate.

-

Lil Eve and Keldeo strolled side-by-side under glowing moss canopies. Their gakuran and seifuku fluttered as pollen shimmered in the air.

Suddenly, ahead: Two human figures, seemingly locked in perpetual embrace.

A muscular man in a futuristic quarterback uniform, carrying his wife, a cheerleader with glasses, tightly hugged in bridal style. Their smiles sparkled as they floated rather than walked. Occasionally, they exchanged gentle kisses like it was still their honeymoon, 3 billion years ago.

Keldeo:

“...Are we hallucinating this?”

Lil Eve’s tail glowed bright pink in embarrassment, a full-on tail boner, spiking her skirt and radiating unfiltered moe shock.

Cheerleader Woman (smiling warmly):

“Aww, you two are adorable! Especially you, little one. May I pet you?”

Lil Eve (still frozen):

“T-Tail… b-bonerrrr…”

Keldeo (gentle sigh):

“Here we go again…”

He lifted Lil Eve bridal style, her face steaming as he turned toward the cheerleader, who gently stroked Lil Eve’s head with motherly affection.

Cheerleader:

“Soft like starlight...”

Then, 

RRRAAGHHRGGHHHH!!!

A muffled screech erupted from Keldeo’s back, yes, it was Regigigas, still strapped in his Tablet of Eternal Loop, dying from sheer cringe suffocation.

Lil Eve (snapping):

“THAT’S ENOUGH!”

She jumped off and unleashed Pulsive Foul Play, smacking the tablet with a grassy shockwave that muted Regigigas’ cries mid-gurgle.

Lil Eve (bowing):

“Forgive us. He’s… a walking embarrassment.”

Quarterback Man (still holding his wife):

“Been there. Respect, young ones.”

Cheerleader Woman (still stroking Lil Eve’s ears):

“Come visit again.”

After a respectful farewell, Lil Eve, cheeks flushed and giddy, suddenly sprouted vines and bride-lifted Keldeo in return, her seifuku fluttering as they flew into the treetops.

-

Meanwhile, on another continent…

Vaporeon, still in her maid swimsuit, carried Flareon across mountain peaks. The "One-Year Maid Carry Challenge" was reaching month 11.

Ninetales and Gardevoir, sitting nearby under parasol shades, politely ignored alien suitors who tried pick-up lines ranging from galaxy poems to poor haikus.

Then, they saw it:

A human woman in classic seifuku, forever carrying her blushing gakuran-clad husband, bridal-style. She had been doing so for 2.5 billion years, and still wasn’t tired.

Seifuku Woman (grinning):

“You four are so cute! Real marriage material.”

Gakuran Man (softly):

“She’s the strongest lifeform I know…”

Flareon (to Vaporeon):

“I feel slightly under-carried now.”

Gardevoir (murmuring):

“This planet… is deliciously unhinged.”

She sipped her cosmic coffee and stared into the middle distance.

“We’re not leaving anytime soon.”

And no one disagreed. Even the Regigigas Tablet tried to clap… before breaking itself again in cringe silence.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

[Scene: Lush Planet “Erosbloom-89” – Galactic Café, Under the Mind-Coral Pavilion]

A quiet breeze brushed over the amphitheater, where various immortal and post-mortal lifeforms lounged on coral recliners and drank fluorescent smoothies. All was peaceful until Gardevoir, dressed eternally in her pencil skirt police-uniform ensemble, stood on a psychically conjured platform, giving a calm lecture.

Gardevoir:

“Through consistent exposure to multidimensional minds, I’ve perfected a psychic field that nullifies language barriers across the galaxy. Meaning is conveyed directly, bypassing syntax, ”

She gestured gently as even non-carbon-based aliens blinked in awe, understanding words they never knew existed.
Keldeo and Lil Eve, holding hands near a levitating bonsai tree, looked on in stunned silence.
Even the Death Loop Tablet on Keldeo’s back vibrated briefly in reverent understanding.

Then… from the side…

Alolan Ninetales, lounging on a frosty couch in her light blue sundress, raised a paw and commented dryly:

Ninetales:

“She’s just a Nine Ball.”

Gardevoir:

“...Thank you.”

And that was when trouble arrived.

-

From behind a psychic pillar, an Octopus-shaped Yuri Fanboy Alien with hearts for eyes burst forth, flailing tentacles and gurgling in passion.

Octopus Alien:

“LESBIANS. ON. SCREEN.”

He pointed dramatically at Gardevoir and Alolan Ninetales, who blinked at each other.

There was a long pause.

Then, with perfectly neutral expressions, they gently leaned in and kissed, brief, soft, and aesthetically correct, like they were checking off a galactic request form.

Gardevoir (telepathically):

“Sorry, Lucario.”

Ninetales (telepathically):

“Apologies, Mamoswine.”

The Octopus alien wept tears of joy, bowed, and floated away satisfied.

Meanwhile, 

Regigigas, still imprisoned in his Death Loop Tablet, witnessed it all. His tablet shook violently, and a pixelated ROCK BONER icon popped up. In sheer shame and overstimulation, the loop force-ejected itself into the nearest interplanetary shredder, with a muffled scream trailing off:

Regigigas:

“I REGRET NOTHINGGG, grrhhhkk, ”

A pause.

Gardevoir:

“He’ll respawn. Again.”

Ninetales:

“One day, he’ll stop screaming. I hope.”

They both sipped their cosmic drinks, the breeze now slightly more awkward.

Lil Eve (to Keldeo):

“...Do you think they’re actually into each other now?”

Keldeo:

“I think they’re into not saying they’re into each other.”

The girls exchanged a silent glance.
Somewhere, a bisexual awakening softly bloomed like pollen in the air.

-

And thus, on a planet full of cuddle couples, alien voyeurs, and resurrecting cringe legends, the immortals carried on.

Forever serene. Forever weird. Forever unhinged.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Scene:
As the crew lounges in their interstellar living room, the Death Loop Tablet begins flickering violently. Flareon lazily lifts a paw, glancing at it with mild disinterest.

Tablet Display: Regigigas flailing in an uncanny yellow lake, face twisted in slow-motion horror. No audio, only a subtitle: “No smell detected.”

Vaporeon: “Did we forget to flush another simulation?”

Alolan Ninetales (sipping an iced drink): “Don’t look at me. I’m ice-type.”

Gardevoir: “...Should we help him?”

Keldeo: “He’ll reset in 15 seconds anyway.”

Lil Eve (giggling): “He always makes it weird.”

Regigigas (subtitled as he sinks): “I have seen eternity. It smells like nothing.”

The crew goes back to watching soap operas from a parallel universe.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Scene: A breezy afternoon on the deck of the ship orbiting a lush, green planet.

Vaporeon and Lil Eve walk in confidently, tails swaying with suspicious pride. Under their frilly skirts, very noticeable oval bulges jiggle with each step.

Flareon (squinting): “...Again?”

Keldeo (deadpan, arms crossed): “Third time this century.”

Vaporeon (grinning): “It’s tradition!”

Lil Eve (mock-innocent): “We wanted to see if you'd cry again.”

Flareon dramatically drops onto his back, tail twitching.
Keldeo just sighs, pulling out a tiny terraforming control device.

Keldeo: “Alright, that’s it. We’re making a planet where Pokémon mortals can live. With pranks banned by law.”

Flareon: “And no oval-shaped anything.”

Regigigas, faintly from the tablet on the table: “Too late… I choked on one... again…”

Everyone ignores him.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Scene: 69 years after the terraforming project, lush valleys sprawl beneath a violet sky, speckled with two suns and a slow orbiting moon made of crystal.

Lil Eve sits beneath a massive glowing tree whose roots hum softly in tune with the soil. Around her gather her descendants, some furred, some scaled, others shimmering with alien traits inherited from unknown corners of the multiverse.

One of her newly born siblings, a Steel-type Eeveelution with chrome fur and luminous, gear-shaped tail fins, sits beside her. His eyes, devoid of pupils, lock onto the flickering Regigigas tablet resting on a mossy stone.

Steelvee: “...Is he always like that?”

The tablet screen shows Regigigas being slowly crushed by two planetary-scale magnets. No sound, just a looping image of his metal frame folding like scrap.

Lil Eve: “Yes. He says it’s better than the shark tank, though.”

A tall, sleek Cosmician Rapidash, one of her children, now grown, approaches, his black flames speckled with fuchsia stars and vapor trails. He squints at the tablet.

Rapidash: “He knows we can turn it off, right?”

Lil Eve: “I think he finds meaning in the suffering.”

Steelvee: “Cosmic masochism... noted.”

Lil Eve chuckles softly and gazes up at the dual suns. Her leafy tail sways with contentment and unease alike.

Lil Eve (softly): “From Pokétopia… to this. The universe sure knows how to unhinge.”

The camera slowly zooms out, the laughter of her mixed kin echoing faintly, while Regigigas silently gets pancaked again in the background.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Scene: The terraformed planet, early evening. Bioluminescent plants begin to glow. Lil Eve's family sprawls across a serene garden-plateau, some relaxing, some playing, some just... existing.

A moment of quiet.

Then, 

Steelvee (standing atop a rock, dramatically raising a chunk of scrap metal like a guitar):
“I… AM STEELVEE!!”
, his voice inexplicably echoing in perfect Jack Black impersonation.

A record-scratch level silence pierces the air.

In the nearby moss-den gaming alcove, Alolan Ninetales and a newly introduced Dragon-type Eeveelution (coiling tail, pastel scales, and ethereal antennae) are locked in a fierce bullet hell danmaku battle on a holographic screen.

Ninetales (mid-dodge, expression icy): “Don’t.”

Dragonvee (laser-focused): “Ignore the cringe, dodge the crin...”

Too late.
Both characters get sniped by a curtain of pink star-bullets.
GAME OVER flashes across the sky.

Ninetales (deadpan): “Great. Now I have to restart Lunatic Mode.”

Dragonvee (hissing): “His cringe has splash damage.”

Back by the rock, Steelvee bows with over-the-top flair. Lil Eve just buries her face in her leaf-paws, laughing.

Meanwhile, in the background, the Regigigas tablet flickers alive just to show him slapping his own stone face in sheer defeat.

Regigigas (muffled): “...Why am I still here… just to suffer…”

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
