Ch 61: Utopia Planets by Gentle Small Dreams

[Scene: Planet Evoir – Chronoscene Reflector Room]

Alolan Ninetales stood quietly before the shimmering Chronoscene Reflector, the folds of her pale blue sundress motionless in the still chamber. Her timeless expression bore the patience only a Hourai-blessed immortal could possess.

Projected before her was a real-time view of Neo-Earth, a restless human world, buzzing with ambition and desperation.

Countless mortals, their lifespans brief, continued to point their eyes and rockets toward unreachable galaxies. Futile dreams.

“They'll never make it in their lifetime...” Alolan Ninetales muttered dryly, flicking her tails with faint disdain. 
“Unless they find a way to live forever, which they likely won't. Mortals always waste what little time they have chasing distant specks... instead of saving the ground beneath their feet.”

The Reflector showed fleets of privately owned spacecrafts lifting off, funded by the elite. These ships rarely returned. Some crash-landed. Others arrived at inhospitable worlds, only to be greeted by cleverly disguised Enefftian Pokémon scammers, who lured desperate travelers into ludicrous schemes.

Alolan Ninetales rolled her eyes.

“Still falling for that ‘free utopia planet’ ad? Honestly.”

-

[Scene Shift: Pokeplanet – Orbit Archive View]

With a whisper of wind from her tails, she tuned the Reflector to a familiar star. The Pokeplanet.

At least here, she mused, many still lived in harmony with their environment. But even this world wasn’t free of hubris.

The display now showed a sleek chrome spaceship landing awkwardly on a barren, dust-gray planet.

Inside: two Steel/Electric-type Pikachu astronauts, descendants of Kantonian Raichu and Alolan Raichu, emerged from their pod with confidence, suits shimmering with tech and pride.

They posed dramatically at the hatch. One tapped a button, and the door slid open.

They stepped out without atmosphere readings. Without caution. Without air.

Moments later, they dropped.

“Brilliant...” Alolan Ninetales said, not even blinking. “Spent a year flying across the void just to suffocate on arrival. No instincts. No humility.”

She turned away from the Reflector, her sundress fluttering as her tails curled thoughtfully behind her.

“They’re always trying to escape. But sometimes, the real escape… is accepting where you are.”

She left the chamber, silence lingering in her wake.

-

[Scene: Planet Evoir – Chronoscene Reflector Room, Day 2]

The polished chamber lit softly as the crystalline reflector stirred to life once more. Alolan Ninetales stepped inside with her usual grace, her pale blue sundress whispering with her motion. This time, she wasn’t alone.

Trailing behind her were two familiar figures, Vaporeon, the ever-composed immortal in her frilled maid dress, and Flareon, her loyal husband in sharp butler uniform. They entered with quiet curiosity, their synchronized footsteps the mark of long companionship.

“I want to show you what I saw yesterday...” Alolan Ninetales murmured, gesturing a gloved paw toward the Reflector as it shimmered again.

She brought up the footage of Neo-Earth’s latest batch of would-be star-chasers, rockets taking off into cold oblivion, elite mortals seeking meaning in distant galaxies. Once again, the three watched as another spacecraft landed on a barren rock, its occupants suffocating moments after stepping into a vacuum they never prepared for.

Vaporeon lowered her ears, sighing.

Flareon shook his head.

“Such waste...” he muttered. “If only they cared for their homes like they care for running from them.”

Alolan Ninetales nodded.

“Which is why I’d like you to see something else.”

With a flick of her tails, the reflector’s projection spun, stars blurring into pink and gold, until it steadied on Erosbloom-89, the planet of love and gentler awakenings.

The image focused on two human figures.

Aqualice, a woman with calm, intelligent eyes behind sleek glasses, her long blue hair swaying with every step. A functional maid dress equipped with subtle water-jet wings carried her with ease. In her arms, always, was her beloved: Burnabon.

He wore a neat butler uniform, his short red hair tousled from motion. His flame-channeling gloves glowed faintly as he cooked, cleaned, and tended with quiet diligence, all while resting in his girlfriend’s bridal carry as though it were the most natural state of being.

For a full year now, they had lived this way, joyfully. Immortal not because they sought escape, but because they responded, unknowingly, to a subconscious cry during their time of despair… a cry answered by Bloominian Meloetta herself.

“No dreams of galaxies...” Alolan Ninetales said softly. “Just love, sustainability, and small things that matter.”

Vaporeon blinked thoughtfully, her fin-like tail swaying.

“They water the plants…”

Flareon added with a small smile,

“...and cook for everyone else, too.”

On the Reflector, Aqualice and Burnabon were now helping a group of local villagers harvest rare fruits near a sun-drenched grove. Burnabon, still carried, threw chopped vegetables into a pot with practiced flicks of his flame-gloves. Aqualice laughed and adjusted her grip, careful not to drop him (cannot drop him anyway), while stirring the pot with her barely free hand.

Vaporeon and Flareon shared a knowing look.

In many ways… it felt like looking into a mirror.

“They really still reminding me of us...” Vaporeon said softly, brushing her fin-hand over Flareon's shoulder.

“But human...” Flareon replied, just as gently, leaning into her touch. “And just as devoted.”

The three immortals watched a little longer. No flying ships. No suffocating. Just food, care, laughter, and love that didn’t need to be shouted into the void of space to matter.

Alolan Ninetales gave a rare, genuine smile.

“And that is how you reach the unreachable.”

-

[Scene: Erosbloom-89 – Eastern Hemisphere, Solarvee’s Garden]

The sky shone with soft gold, brushing its warmth over the rolling, fertile slopes of the eastern region. Sun-kissed breeze danced across the layered gardens built into the rocky terrain, each terrace blooming with edible flowers and hardy vegetables, well-cared for by none other than Solarvee, the Rock/Psychic explorer girl.

Dressed in her signature sun visor and practical boots, Solarvee hummed softly as she levitated a cluster of nutrient-rich stones into the soil, enhancing the roots of her crimson-rooted radishes. She glanced up at the sight of familiar shadows approaching.

Aqualice drifted into view, ever serene, her water-jet wings gliding low above the earth. In her arms, as always, is Burnabon, resting with one arm slung over her shoulder, his fire gloves tucked behind his back like a sleeping ember. Together, they landed beside Solarvee, the gentle spray of water wings watering some nearby bushes mid-landing.

“Mind if we help with lunch?” Aqualice offered with a warm smile.

Solarvee grinned and waved them in with a rock-levitated basket of sweetroots.

“You two know the drill. Burnabon, you’re in charge of grilling again.”

Burnabon smirked from within his eternal cradle.

“As long as Aqualice doesn’t try to roast the veggies mid-carry again…”

A gentle nudge from her water jet made him hush with a smile.

Not far off, a third presence watched them with half-hearted interest. Enefftian Arcanine, Electric/Psychic type, and former resident scammer of NFT777-Enefftia, stood by a shallow rock pool with a fishing rod balanced on his shoulder. His fur was windswept, and his manners cleaner now. He’d been stuck here on Erosbloom-89 for over a year… and something had changed.

Gone were the horniness and sales pitches. Now he wandered the coasts as a simple fisherman, trading fresh catches for vegetables and conversation.

Spotting Solarvee, he approached with a grin.

“You know, you’re glowing today. Did the rocks compliment you, or is it just me?”

Solarvee didn’t even blink. With one psychic tug, she floated a few coins toward him and took the basket of glimmering fish.

“Here. Payment in full. Now go.”

Arcanine blinked.

“...Right. See ya.”

He turned and left, tail flicking once, voice muttering a good-natured “You’re no fun” as he vanished into the rocky path back to the coast.

Just as the fish were being placed into preparation trays by levitating stones, another pair of immortals floated down gently beside the garden wall.

Seifuku Woman and her beloved, Gakuran Man, an ancient couple of unfathomable age, their love having lasted 2.5 billion years, waved warmly. As always, she carried him in bridal fashion, and he rested comfortably as if it were second nature. Which, by now, it was.

“Still gardening, Solarvee?” Seifuku Woman called out.

“Still carrying him?” Solarvee quipped back with a grin.

The group laughed as they set up the long lunch table under the flowering sunbramble tree. Friends reunited, comfort as eternal as the sunlight on this planet.

-

[Scene Shift: Planet Evoir – Chronoscene Reflector Room]

The ethereal crystals of the chamber glowed faintly as the latest scene played: gardens, laughter, couples held in arms, eternal peace.

Vaporeon, still in her maid dress, leaned gently forward with a sparkle in her eye, and, without warning, scooped Flareon into her arms again.

“I’m not letting you go the rest of the day...” she teased, adjusting her hold just enough to make it snug.

Flareon, dressed in his butler uniform, sputtered.

“H-Hey! This isn’t part of the...!” He folded his arms and turned his head, blushing.
“...Whatever. Not like I hate it or anything.”

Vaporeon smirked.

“Tsundere confirmed.”

The chamber doors opened with a soft tone, and Gardevoir, still aglow with authority and wisdom, stepped in, her psychic presence mingling with the warmth of the room. She looked around at the joyful mischief of her fellow immortals and at the peaceful replay of Erosbloom-89's surface projected above.

She crossed her arms, satisfied.

“This is what I fought for...” she said calmly. “A solar system where dreams stopped being toxic and started becoming gentle.”

The others nodded, knowing full well: it wasn’t just peace they’d built.

It was a future that no one needed to escape from.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Ch 62: Ingenius Math Descendants of Ninetales

[Scene: Pokeplanet – Present Day, 6.9 Million Light Years from Evoir]
Location: Poketopia (yes, still called that)

Time has pushed forward, billions of years since the golden eras of Ho-Oh’s miracles and the reign of legendaries. The rebirths have ended. True legendaries and mythicals now belong only to the history scrolls. The last of them perished over 2 billion years ago, precisely 390 years after the events of Saga 4.

And yet, Poketopia still stands.

No longer a tourist hub, it is now a fortified, high-security city-state where caution rules policy. After millennia of chaos, it became clear: no divine phoenix would come to undo mistakes anymore.

But hope doesn’t always need revival.

In the educational district on the southern edge, a dual-typed Eeveelution, Fire/Water-type, clad in shimmering Heatran-plated scales, stood at the front of a dome-shaped youth center. Her tail curled neatly, steam rising softly from the contrast of fire and water as she lectured calmly, a holo-slate levitating before her.

This was Heatranvee, descendant of Vaporeon and Flareon, born of Poketopian roots and the gentle principles they’d passed on.

Two young students sat before her, still trembling a little.
A Ground/Dark-type Neonian Piloswine, shaggy and uncertain, and beside her, a more delicate-looking Ice/Psychic Neonian Braixen with crystalline ears and a troubled gaze.

They were cousins, descendants of Greninja x Delphox and Mamoswine x Alolan Ninetales. Despite their powerful bloodlines, their spirits had faltered.

“Our math exam grades dropped off a cliff…” Neonian Braixen mumbled, nearly tearing up.
“We tried to memorize everything, but it just wouldn’t stick.”

Neonian Piloswine nodded slowly, eyes dim.

Heatranvee gave them a patient look, then used her tail to tap the holographic display.

“Because memorization alone isn’t learning...” she said firmly. “You didn't understand the why. That’s the root of good thinking, something more important than any revival.”

She opened a practice exercise not from the exam but from their daily lives, counting soil acidity ratios, predicting steam pressure curves.

Slowly, their eyes began to light up.

Behind them, a wall plaque quietly displayed names of founders and moral pillars: Vaporeon. Flareon. Lil Eve. Keldeo.

Their legacy lived on, if not in miracles, then in small victories.

-

[Scene: Planet Evoir – Chronoscene Reflector Chamber]

The glowing panels cast soft illumination across the round crystal platform. Three immortals sat together, watching the distant feed from Pokeplanet: Alolan Ninetales, ever elegant in her light blue sundress; Vaporeon, tail lazily wrapped around Flareon’s; and Flareon, flopped in her arms again, being quietly carried without protest.

The room was peaceful... until a sigh broke the silence.

“Why is my lineage so mentally fragile sometimes…?” Alolan Ninetales muttered, eyes drifting away from the screen.

“Maybe it's all those brains and no chill...” Flareon shrugged.

Vaporeon poked him in the side.

“Hey. Be nice.”

The doors slid open with a cheerful hum, and Lil Eve floated in like a breeze, still dressed in her iconic schoolgirl seifuku, immortal eyes shining like stars.

“Saw the whole thing already...” she chimed. “That Heatranvee’s doing a great job. You should be proud.”

Alolan Ninetales blinked.

“Still… maybe I should start a math class.”

Lil Eve grinned wider.

“Only if you finally pass your coding test first.”

A beat of silence. Then...

“Oh please not that again...” Alolan Ninetales groaned, tail drooping as Vaporeon burst into gentle laughter.

Even Flareon cracked a smile as the room shifted from legacy to levity, glowing softly under the starlight of a future still being written.

-

[Scene: Planet Evoir – Chronoscene Reflector Room, Later That Day]

The crystal orb shimmered again, catching everyone's attention as it switched feeds. The peaceful Pokeplanet visuals faded, replaced by an explosion of garish colors and dissonant jingle tunes.

The new feed was live: a drone transmission from NFT777-Enefftia, the infamous casino-planet.

The camera, mounted on a floating scout drone, zipped through the chaotic neon skyline of the gacha-glutted empire. Gaudy banners waved across skyscrapers in pixelated flames and rainbows. Giant screens flashed grotesquely overhyped slogans:

“Draw NOW for a chance at the ultra-rare LEGENDARY HUMAN WAIFU!!”
“SQUARE ROOT SPECIAL EVENT: √((((((((2)))))))) PERCENT CHANCE!”
“NEW NINETALES-THEMED FIGURINE SET, 0.0000003% DROP RATE!!”

Controlling the drone feed remotely were two of the most dangerous minds from the past war: Serenede, the coldly efficient human war strategist, and Enefftian Ninetales, her playful yet cunning vulpine accomplice, herself descended from Alolan Ninetales, yet corrupted by the Enefftian culture of profit and temptation.

They laughed over comms as the banners flickered by, each more absurd than the last.

Inside the Chronoscene Reflector Room, Alolan Ninetales instinctively squinted.

“Oh no...” she muttered. “Not that format again... Who even writes drop rates like that?”

Lil Eve leaned closer, eyes mischievous.

“Come on, do it. Code it. I dare you.”

Alolan Ninetales narrowed her eyes.

“You want me to decode √((((((((2)))))))) just to make a point?”

“Yep.”

“...Fine.”

She pulled out a palm-sized crystal terminal, her tail tapping rhythmically against the floor as she brought up a minimal compiler. Her delicate claws danced across the glowing keys.

Seconds later, she stopped. The result hovered on screen:

≈ 1.41421356% drop rate

Alolan Ninetales stared at it flatly.

“And that's supposed to be exciting?”

Lil Eve smirked.

“Hey, better than 0.0000003%.”

Alolan Ninetales sighed with all the weight of someone who had seen the rise and fall of galaxies.

“How did a descendant of mine end up enabling this?”

Vaporeon peeked over her shoulder and snorted.

“At least they didn’t use imaginary numbers this time.”

Flareon, still being held, tilted his head.

“Give them a week.”

They all groaned in unison.

-

Another spaceship, clearly from the same creators, suddenly dashed in and slammed into the earlier gacha-bannered vessel. 
This time, the drop rate displayed across its hull was even more grotesque:

√√√√√√√√2

In a synthesized voice, the ship politely announced apologies to any nearby alien species for the previous ship’s existence.

The now-crashed gacha ship spiraled out of control and landed squarely on another of Enefftia’s scam vessels, this one a garish MLM ad ship. It had no passengers, only an unnamed automated controller.

Noting the collision, the MLM ship promptly rerouted itself directly into a drifting asteroid. Its guidance system, confused by the solar system’s magnetic field and unable to detect the invisible local sun, registered no reason to stay.

Back in the Chronoscene Room, Alolan Ninetales stared in silence... then facepalmed.

“My descendants are... actual ‘math genius idiots,’” she muttered.

With a sigh, she typed out the unholy √√√√√√√√2 into her interface and calculated the drop rate.

The result popped up on screen.

“It’s even lower. Just by a bit.”

She facepalmed again, ears twitching in mild disbelief.

“I’ve lived for about two billion years to see... this...” she said, dryly. “And somehow, it’s funny.”

-

Alolan Ninetales was still staring blankly at the screen when the door slid open behind her.

She turned, just in time to see Flareon, tightly wrapped in fire-proof and watery ropes, being effortlessly carried in Vaporeon’s arms like a squirming plush toy.

His fluffy tail twitched in protest.
“H-Hey! It’s not like I wanted to be tied up or anything…! I was just trying to, guh, explain logically!” he stammered, looking away with a deep blush.

Vaporeon narrowed her eyes at him. “You were rude to Ninetales.”

Without giving him time to wriggle out of his excuse, she leaned in and kissed him squarely on the cheek, firm, slow, and smug.
“That’s your punishment...” she whispered.

Alolan Ninetales blinked once, then twice. “…You two are unbelievable.”

As if in sync, all three turned their attention back to the glowing math result still lingering on the screen.

√√√√√√√√2 ≈ 1.090507732

There was a long pause.

Flareon, still in Vaporeon’s hold, tilted his head. “That’s… it?”

Vaporeon blinked. “…That’s barely even lower than just √2.”

Alolan Ninetales exhaled a long, dry breath. “Two billion years of wisdom and this is what the galaxy gives me…”

They all silently agreed, this entire mathematical scam thing was stupid. But in a way, tragically hilarious.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Ch 63: KELDEO-E

[Scene: Evoir, Filming Fields – The Next Morning]
The soft golden sky of Evoir cast its morning glow over the grassy plains near the Chronoscene Tower. Vaporeon, still in her frilly maid dress, glided gracefully through the field with a mischievous smile, her arms still wrapped tightly around a tied-up Flareon, who had yet to regain his freedom. His fluffy tail flicked in quiet protest, but he wasn’t truly upset. His cheeks were tinted with a tsundere red.

Flareon (mumbling through the fireproof-and-watery ropes):
"Th-this is a violation of autonomy..."

Vaporeon (teasing):
“Shush, you're still being punished for mocking Ninetales.”

The two paused as a new figure approached, Keldeo, the immortal gakuran-wearing Water/Fighting stallion. His confident stride was matched by the clanging sounds of something mechanical galloping behind him.

Beside him rolled the recently unveiled creation:
KELDEO-E, a shining sword-wielding, junk-collecting, ridable robot horse, glistening with metallic aqua plating and powered by a solar-mana core. Commissioned by Galaxian Magnezone, this machine bore the dignified stance of a knight and the purpose of a restorationist.

In the distance, Evoirian Rapidash, a dazzling Fire/Water mare, stood ready with steam rising gently from her mane, serving as the director in Keldeo’s upcoming film, KELDEO-E: The Rebirth Circuit.

Lil Eve stood nearby, wearing her usual sailor uniform, tapping on her oversized drone controller. Floating beside her was BIGEVE, the eight-elemental flying Eevee-shaped mech, its tails glowing in rotating hues.

Lil Eve (nodding):
“I came up with the KELDEO-E concept after seeing those Neo-Earth human elites chasing galaxies again... and still letting their own planet rot.”

Keldeo (patting the mech's side):
“Let them chase stars. I’ll plant trees under the moonlight.”

BIGEVE whirred approvingly, puffing out tiny gusts of wind and fire, creating a small double rainbow in the air.

Flareon (still tied):
“Where's my robot…”

Vaporeon:
“You are my robot.”

Lil Eve (grinning):
“Let’s film something that matters for once, not gacha, not scams, not square roots of disappointment. Just meaning.”

-

[One Month Later – The Premiere of KELDEO-E: The Rebirth Circuit]

Across projectors in solar gardens and floating screens over serene Evoirian skies, the long-awaited film KELDEO-E rolled out. Attendees across Evoir and sympathetic corners of Erosbloom-89 tuned in, many gathering in community theaters with flowers in hand and recycled snacks on plates.

-

[Act 1 – The Longing]

KELDEO-E, the outdated robot stallion, patrols the ruins of Neo-Earth. With a worn mane of wires and rust-flecked hooves, he plays old records of romantic humans, couples holding hands, dancing under lamplight, sharing meals. He sighs, a mechanical whinny echoing through the hollow cityscape.

KELDEO-E (internal monologue, static-pitched):
"I was built to serve. To ride beside them. To love their life... not mourn their memory."

-

[Act 2 – The Intrusion]

A thunderous descent. A spaceship lands, filled with chrome-plated resource-collector bots, every model visibly superior in design. Among them floats BIGEVE, sleek, deadly, Eevee-shaped with a feminine voice and eight-elemental capability.

BIGEVE scans KELDEO-E. Target lock: "Obsolete."

He panics, hides, trembles in the shadows. His sensors pick up... life. A lone green sapling, struggling in concrete.

Gently potting it, he rolls out. Offers it to her, a token of peace.

BIGEVE stares.

Then, without a word...

She bridal carries him, sapling still safe in his hooves, soaring skyward.

-

[Act 3 – The Betrayal]

Back aboard the mothership, suspicion brews. The elite robots gather.

A drone snarls, “Unauthorized relic detected.”

BIGEVE shields him.

“I’m not like you. I don’t erase. I remember.”

With a burst of rainbow plasma, she unleashes a full elemental barrage ,  fire, water, electric, grass ,  blasting her way through. KELDEO-E is helpless in her arms, clutching the sapling as they bolt toward the last remaining humans.

-

[Act 4 – The Confrontation]

The humans... have grown corpulent. Lazy. Distracted by food tubes and idle luxuries.

BIGEVE sets KELDEO-E down.

He steps forward, trembling.

“Please... one more chance. For life.”

A slovenly man scoffs, but BIGEVE charges her lightning. He flees.

A lone woman steps up.

“...Let’s try again.”

Others join, moved.

-

[Act 5 – The Return]

They land on Neo-Earth. The pot is placed.

BIGEVE summons Grass. KELDEO-E performs a watery Sword Dance, drenching the soil with purified runoff.

A young human approaches and hands him a gleaming, updated sword.

They all watch as the sapling shivers... then blossoms.

-

[Act 6 – The Bloom]

The planet breathes again.

Humans jog. Gardens return. Lakes ripple. Life pulses.

On a hill, KELDEO-E and BIGEVE stand proudly. She bridal carries him under a tree of iridescent leaves, metallic petals fluttering in the breeze.

She kisses him. Their forms gleam beneath twin suns.

The End.

-

[Post-Film Reactions – Evoir, Evening]

In the soft glow of the Chronoscene Room:

Vaporeon still cradles Flareon, who remains tied up even after a full month, slightly more resigned to his fate, but clearly still tsundere.

Flareon (grumbling):
“Tch... overdramatic film... but... not bad.”

Vaporeon (smiling, tail swishing):
“I saw you blush at the kiss scene.”

Flareon:
“D-did not!”

Lil Eve descends nearby, proudly bridal carrying Keldeo, the original immortal stallion himself, now grinning sheepishly like a rebellious boyfriend caught red-hooved.

Lil Eve:
“Think the humans got the message?”

Keldeo:
“If not, we'll make a sequel.”

All four gaze at the final still image on the screen, a sapling silhouetted against a reborn sky, and nod in solemn joy.

-

[Scene: After the Film – Echoes and Growth]

The film ended.
The Reflector screen dimmed, humming softly as it shut itself down.

A moment of stillness followed. Then, with a mechanical flutter, a glossy promotional poster slid out from the Reflector's archive slot and drifted to the floor.

Title:
"KELDEO-E: The Rebirth Circuit"

Printed on it: KELDEO-E, smiling calmly, eyes soft and sincere. Beside him stood BIGEVE, her expression warm, protective, almost maternal. Behind them, stylized circuitry bloomed like vines beneath a peaceful sky. It wasn’t menacing.
It wasn’t cold.
It was… hopeful.

And yet, that image brought everything crashing back.

-

Gardevoir’s breath hitched the moment she saw the word synthetic. Her eyes narrowed.
She remembered the metallic snap of bone, the smell of scorched Hatterene fur.
Her impostor bot had looked just like her. Had acted like her.
Had killed an innocent Hatterene before she could intervene.
She’d torn that machine apart herself, assisted by Miraidon.
Watched her own face shatter into twisted chrome.

-

Alolan Ninetales’ fur bristled beside her.
She remembered waking up inside ice, trapped, paralyzed.
Hearing her impostor using her voice, then the impostor got destroyed by Mimikyu embarassingly.
The way it mocked her without ever saying a word.
She hadn’t screamed. She couldn't.

-

Gardevoir turned away.
Ninetales followed.
Their exit was wordless, abrupt.

Lil Eve blinked. “What just...?”

Keldeo looked from the poster to the empty doorway. “They were... upset?”

“They were impersonated...” Lil Eve murmured. “Back in the Bot War. Saga 3. Without consent.”

“They think this is happening again?”

“No. They remember.”

A heavy silence fell.

Then, a few minutes later, quiet footsteps returned. Gardevoir stood in the doorway again, Alolan Ninetales just behind her.

They didn’t speak at first. Gardevoir simply walked up to the poster and studied it again, really looked at it.

KELDEO-E’s smile was genuine.
BIGEVE’s stance wasn’t imposing. It was protective. Almost gentle.

“…This isn’t them...” Gardevoir finally said.

“No. It’s not...” Alolan Ninetales agreed. Her voice was softer now.

Gardevoir exhaled. “Sorry for storming out.”

Lil Eve smiled faintly. “You earned that right, many times over.”

Keldeo nodded. “You still want to leave?”

Gardevoir shook her head. “No. We’ll stay.”

“We’ve seen monsters wear our faces before...” Alolan Ninetales said. “Doesn’t mean every synthetic does.”

Gardevoir gave a quiet nod toward the poster. “Let’s give them a chance.”

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Ch 64 : 9 Minus 1 Then Square Math Class

[Scene : The Quiet Entry]
Setting: The polished wooden hallway leading into the Evoirian living room.

Vaporeon walked with steady grace, arms wrapped securely around Flareon’s form. The once-fiery butler was still bound in soaked, fireproof ropes, his tail flicking just slightly in protest, more from pride than discomfort.

She stepped into the living room without announcement. The atmosphere was peaceful, the air cooled by slow-turning ceiling fans. Alolan Ninetales sat by the window, cloaked in the soft glow of late afternoon, her light blue sundress fluttering faintly in the breeze.

Flareon stirred, glancing toward her. There was no hostility, no rivalry, just recognition.

-

[Scene : A Quiet Compliment]
Setting: The same room, still, with only the sounds of wind and distant birds.

Flareon’s ears twitched before he finally broke the silence.

"You know... your descendants..." he said, his voice dry but sincere, "They’ve inherited more than just your looks. Clever. Practical. They’re... sharp in all the right ways."

Alolan Ninetales looked toward him slowly. Her gaze was not cold, merely reflective. She said nothing, but her silence gave weight to his words. No deflection. No sarcasm. Just a moment acknowledged.

-

[Scene : Release]
Setting: Center of the living room rug, sunlight spilling across the floor.

Vaporeon gently knelt, still holding Flareon with care. With methodical fingers, she began to untie the soaked bindings, each knot loosened with a soft rustle.

The ropes fell away one by one until Flareon was finally free, the damp remnants coiling loosely on the floor like discarded memories.

She helped him sit upright, her expression calm, yet touched with the quiet satisfaction of resolution.

-

[Scene : Iced Tea and Subtle Thanks]
Setting: Small side table in the living room, with a pitcher and three glasses.

Flareon stood up on his own, rolling his stiff shoulders before making his way to the tray. He carefully poured the tea, taking extra care not to let his inner heat warm the glass.

He carried it to Alolan Ninetales without flair or sarcasm, offering it with the proper form of a servant, though not without meaning. She took it, nodding once in acceptance.

-

[Scene : A Pat, and a Grin]
Setting: By the center of the room, as the sun lowers and shadows begin to stretch.

As Flareon turned to retreat, Vaporeon gently reached out and patted his head.

A pause.

He didn’t brush her off, didn’t scoff. Instead, a slow, sideways grin crept across his face.
"Yeah, yeah... I missed this too..." he muttered, not looking at her but not hiding either.

For the first time in months, his pre-tsundere warmth surfaced, not burning, just gently glowing.

-

[Scene : Chapter 64 Realization]
Setting: Still in the living room, the atmosphere peaceful and light-hearted.

As the calm settled, Alolan Ninetales’s eyes narrowed thoughtfully.

“This… is the 64th chapter...” she said, almost to herself. Then a faint, foxlike smirk curved her lips. “Perfect.”

She rose from her seat and, with a practiced flick of her tail, summoned six old and new devices beside her, each glowing faintly, from retro to modern.

“2-bit. 4-bit. 8-bit. 16-bit. 32-bit. And now...” She turned grandly. “64-bit.”

The room shimmered with quiet blue light as she struck a pose, invoking a subtle melody, Alolan Ninetale’s Perfect Math Class, an ancient remix from the Dragonlet danmaku archive. The tune played softly in the background as she began to code midair with icy glyphs.

-

[Scene : The Math Flex]
Setting: Symbols hover in a projected grid around her like a floating chalkboard.

“Let’s finish with elegance...” she whispered with pride, and with a curl of her tail, typed:

(9 − 1)² =

The result pulsed: 64.

“Perfectly square. Perfectly elegant...” she declared, tail swaying like a metronome.

-

[Scene : Reactions and Revival of Playfulness]
Setting: Still the living room, now filled with playful, nostalgic tech aura.

Flareon blinked at her performance. “That was... ridiculous...” he muttered.

But then, after a pause, he clapped. “Ridiculously impressive.”

Vaporeon nodded with a small, proud smile, then added her own soft clapping, just enough to turn the teasing moment into something warmer.

Flareon turned to her, not resisting the pull of the moment anymore. “Y’know what...”
He leapt into her arms, bridal-style, tail curling with satisfaction. “I missed being carried.”

She caught him effortlessly, chuckling, and kissed his forehead once, 

Then twice...

And again...

Until it reached sixty-four gentle kisses, like ticking numbers in her memory.
He melted into her arms with each one, no longer resisting who he was with her.

-

[Scene : United Applause]
Alolan Ninetales watched the scene unfold with raised eyebrows, then calmly joined in the applause, her tails clapping like fans folding open. The music faded into gentle echoes.

“Chapter sixty-four...” she said with a knowing smirk. “Not bad for a math class.”

-

[Scene : Advanced Math, the Unhinged Way]
Setting: The same living room, bathed in the fading light of late afternoon, soft tech-glow from the bit devices still present.

With the 64-bit finale still floating beside her, Alolan Ninetales flicked her tail again and summoned a new string of icy equations in the air.

“Let’s go deeper...” she murmured, smirking like a professor with too much free time.

She wrote:

((9 − 1)²) + (√9 + ⁶√64)

The symbols pulsed once, 
64 + (3 + 2) = 69

She paused. Glanced at the others.

Then, with no shame, declared softly but confidently:

"Nice."

Her tone was utterly composed, dignified... and completely self-aware.

-

[Scene : Affection Multiplied]
Vaporeon giggled behind her paw, then turned back to Flareon, still content in her arms.

“Well then...” she said, tightening her hold just slightly, “Since it’s still the 64th chapter…”

She leaned down and kissed him again.

Once.

Twice.

Three more times.

Five in total.

A bonus round.

Flareon blinked, still blushing from the earlier barrage, but this time he clapped, while still in her arms, with the enthusiasm of someone surrendering to joy.

“This...” he said with a wide grin, “is unhingedly cute. Who knew math could feel like this?”

-

[Scene : The Echo of Wholesomeness]
Alolan Ninetales closed her floating math panels with a swirl of ice, but her tail still twitched in amusement. “That’s because you were never in my class.” she quipped.

Vaporeon rocked Flareon gently in her arms, her smile calm, proud, and just a bit smug.

And for a moment, even with immortal weight behind their souls, the three of them let the silliness linger, a moment where elegance, play, and affection intersected like perfect geometry.

-

Author’s Note :
Immortality Doesn’t Cancel Karma

Flareon’s month-long restraint, bound in waterlogged, fireproof ropes and carried effortlessly in Vaporeon’s arms, wasn’t just a humorous punishment. It was karma, distilled into immortal form.

His blunt remark about Alolan Ninetales’ descendants back in Chapter 62 may have seemed minor in mortal time, but among the ageless, every word has echo. And Vaporeon, ever the graceful enforcer of balance, delivered that echo with soft strength and sensual discipline.

Yet what matters most is not the punishment, but Flareon’s growth from it.

He came to realize that his recent tsundere edge had grown sharper than it should. Pride had blurred into bluntness. Deflection had masked his sincerity. And while never cruel, he’d lost some of the warmth that once defined him.

So here, in Chapter 64, he finally let go of the pride and gave honest praise, not just to right a wrong, but because he meant it. In doing so, he earned his release, not just from the ropes, but from a fragment of his own emotional restraint.

And in her usual calm strength, Vaporeon welcomed this moment of clarity. She didn’t just untie him. She kissed him. Praised him. Carried him again, this time, by his own choice.

Because even in a world where love endures forever, it still needs to be nurtured, checked, and reshaped. And karma, as always, remembers.

End of Chapter 64

Ch 65: Poketopia 3 Glitched Boss Rush

Scene : Loop of Trials
In the infinite stillness of the Death Loop Tablet, Regigigas endures yet another game, another performance in pursuit of a more merciful death.

Lately, his efforts have not gone unseen. The ground/steel-type streamer, Cosmician Sandslash, has been broadcasting Regigigas’ games to wide acclaim. What was once silent torment is now spectacle, offering him dignity, if not peace.

-

Scene : The Bot Gauntlet Announcement
One day, the tablet shifts.

A new challenge appears:
Fight all 30 illusion-replicated bots from the old Bot War, the terror that once plagued Pokeplanet in Saga 3.

Victory grants a gentle death... delivered by Durabot’s soft Dragon Pulse.

Regigigas pauses.
He remembers them well. He’s seen their war footage, a copy gifted to him by the real, immortal policewoman Gardevoir.
Even Alolan Ninetales, serene in her sundress, had turned away in embarrassment when her bot’s footage played.

-

Scene : Opening Rounds – Cannon Fodder
He begins with the weakest:

Blisseybot slaps him harmlessly. Regigigas flicks her away like a leaf.

Greedentbot follows, no threat.

Pikabot is next. Gigas scoffs: "This one represents fear? Pathetic."

Slowbot, Eldebot, and Venubot offer slightly more resistance, but fall all the same.

-

Scene : Avenge the Fallen
Then comes Cinderbot.

Regigigas narrows his eyes.
He remembers Cinderace, one of Darkrai’s murder victims in Saga 2.
"This one fell to darkness..." he mutters, and with a thunderous blow, he “avenges” the fallen.

-

Scene : Mid-Tier Brawls
Sylveonbot, Wigglybot, Garchompbot, Zardbot (Charizard's bot), Zerabot, Snorlaxbot, each one manageable.

Then:

Crustlebot.
The walls press in. The trolling is real.
But Regigigas recalls the NaclCraft mod. He counters the maze’s logic and strikes the core.

-

Scene : Ice and Grief
Ninetalebot appears, freezing the air.

He remembers falling to this illusion before.
"Not this time." He pierces the bot’s chest.
"Forgive me, real one..."

Mamobot follows. Unknown to him, he mimics Mamoswine, the long-lost husband of Alolan Ninetales. He defeats him without knowing the sorrow he stirs.

-

Scene : Creators and Regrets
Then, twin echoes of redemption:

Mimebot, the reflection of the fallen creator.

Crambot, the partner in crime.

He hesitates... and bows before striking.
"Your real selves saved my world. Rest now."

-

Scene : Steep Climb Begins
Next come the heavy hitters:

Absolbot, Talonbot, Gengarbot, Blastoisebot, all strong, but not unbeatable.

Greninjabot uses Double Team to infuriating effect, but is eventually stomped.

-

Scene : Fighting Spirit
Then, the wildest fight: Machampbot.

He approaches with glowing ゴゴゴ aura, fists flying in a JoJo-style ORA ORA ORA barrage.

"This is Fighting Wind Requiem!" he roars, "You will never reach the truth!"

Regigigas mutters, "King Crimson."
He lands a perfect surprise counter. Machampbot falls.

-

Scene : Personal Echoes
Lucabot down.
He remembers the real Lucario, Gardevoir’s late husband. His eyes soften.

Gardebot is vicious, moonblasting, black-holing.
Regigigas finds a pole, counters her slowness, and slams her into defeat.
"Forgive me, true protector."

-

Scene : Final Trials
Trevbot mocks him. “Bots are the future.”
Regigigas ignites a flame cannon. No future for this one.

Dragobot whispers: “Kill yourself. Let go.”
Regigigas redirects the divebomb strikes and ejects the bot into space.

Espeonbot hits where it hurts, replaying past death scenes, violating his psyche.
"No..." he mutters, "Flareon's real mother would never do this."
He plants surprise bombs and ends her.

-

Scene : The Final Boss
Tyranitarbot.

A fair, one-on-one slugfest, no illusions, just pure strength.

Regigigas remembers killing the real Tyranitar in Saga 4, only for Ho-Oh to resurrect him... and die in return.

"Stone. Floor. Slam."
He breaks the bot with dignity.

-

Scene : Mercy Granted
Then, Durabot appears, calm, warm, and kind.

No malice. No hostility.

Just a gentle, whispering Dragon Pulse to grant Regigigas the least painful death he’s earned all cycle.

-

Scene : Stream Applause
From outside the Death Loop Tablet, Cosmician Sandslash grins.

His chat explodes in applause.
He raises a metal claw: "Let’s give it up for our gentle titan, Regigigas!"

-

Scene : Chat Reactions and Reverence
The stream erupts.

Cosmician Sandslash’s chat floods with praise:

"He bowed to Mimebot... that’s class."
"Did you see how he spared no blow, yet respected the real ones?!"
"The queen would be proud... Gardebot may fall, but Gardevoir stands eternal."

Some viewers even clip the apology to Gardebot and the whisper to Ninetalebot, calling them “the kindest deathblows ever delivered in gaming history.”

-

Scene : The Forwarded Stream
Cosmician Sandslash hesitates for a moment… then decides.

He forwards the full VOD to Gardevoir, knowing she will understand the nuance.
He doesn’t forward it to Alolan Ninetales, not out of malice, but out of tact.
She’s proud, and that bot... wasn't her finest hour.

-

Scene : Reactions at the Immortals' Domain
In the eternal villa atop Evoir's observatory, Gardevoir receives the footage.

She watches quietly, eyes calm, one hand over her heart.

A soft smile forms.

But she isn’t alone.

From the corner, Alolan Ninetales had peeked.
She watches too.

When Ninetalebot appears and freezes... only to be pierced with an apology...
Her ears twitch.
Her cheeks burn.

She dives under a pillow, mortified.

-

Scene : Enter the Fire and the Tide
Moments later, the Fireboy and Watergirl arrive.

Flareon, the immortal butler, senses something’s up.
Vaporeon, ever graceful, leans beside her embarrassed husband.

Then Flareon sees Espeonbot on the playback.

His breath stops.
That was the impostor of his mother.

He clenches a paw softly.

“I still remember... Saga 3...” he murmurs. “When I couldn’t move... when her face wasn’t hers anymore...”

Vaporeon nods gently.

“I remember too. That’s when I lifted you... bridal style. And Saga 4 onwards... It all started from there.”

A warm silence.
Alolan Ninetales hears them from under the pillow.

-

Scene : Deflection and Thermometers
Alolan Ninetales peeks out, ears red.

She blurts, “S-So... how’s that thermometer challenge going, Flareon?”

He blinks. “Wait, what...?”

“Let’s go test it in the lab! Temperature resilience, right?” she insists.

Vaporeon chuckles.
“Water between fire and ice...” she teases. “I’ll be the safety net.”

-

Scene : A Heated Lab Break
In the immortal lab, chaos ensues:

The room’s temperature spikes from Flareon’s side.

Ice crystals and temperature dropped form on Alolan Ninetales’ side.

Vaporeon swirls through the middle, keeping balance.

Their laughter echoes through the crystal walls.

From afar, Gardevoir watches the chaos and smiles again, fond and motherly.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Ch 66: The Boy Who Loved Bugs, 666 Parent Warns

[Scene - Flashback, Neo-Earth, Some Years Ago]
There once lived a boy on Neo-Earth.
He didn't speak much.
He didn't make many friends.
He collected insects.

Not to harm.
Not to dominate.
But to understand.

He built tiny homes for beetles in the roots of trees.
Named every butterfly he met.
Whispered softly to centipedes like they were his classmates.

He called himself Buggleby.
No one else ever used that name. Only he did.

His parents didn't understand.

“Catching bugs? That’s not how you make a living.”
“Stop being weird.”
“You need a real future, in a store, an office, anywhere normal.”

They mocked his notebooks.
Burned his sketches.
Threw out his beetle jars.

But when you're told your love is unacceptable long enough…
Eventually, something breaks.

And so it did.

Buggleby fought back.
Physically. Emotionally. Loudly.

The system labeled him a danger.
Society deemed him a mistake.
His parents… too little, too late.

And so, they exiled him.
To Diamond-666, the cold fortress world of authoritarian humanity.

-

[Scene - Diamond-666, Before the Peace, The Scientist’s Descent]
On Diamond-666, where kindness was a liability and empathy a myth, Buggleby thrived, if one could call it that.

Among broken geniuses and scarred minds, he joined humanity’s grimmest scientific circle.
Together, they developed Poké Balls, containment orbs born from both fascination and obsession.

For Buggleby, it was no longer about sharing life with insects.
It was about owning them.
Controlling them.
Reducing nature to parameters.

He never laughed again.

One day, without ceremony, Buggleby stood before the capsule bay, waved once to the scientist-leader Oaker, and ejected himself into deep space.

He did not scream.
He did not look back.
He had programmed the course himself:

Into the system’s sun.

A glowing farewell to a world that never let him belong.

His parents tried to apologize.
To reverse the exile.
To say the words they never said.

But by then…

It was too late.

-

[Scene - On Evoir, in Present Day]
The tale was recovered and rendered into crystal holovid.
Evoir’s mortal education council marked it “Essential Viewing: Parental Responsibility.”

In the immortal family wing, a rare moment unfolded.

Flareon, in his butler garb, sat still.
Vaporeon, the eternal maid, curled her water-trimmed tail around her family.
And between them, in a neatly pressed seifuku uniform, sat Lil Eve, their daughter, the immortal born of contrast and care.

The video ended.
No music.
No narration.
Only silence.

Flareon's flames dimmed as he blinked at nothing.
Vaporeon looked to her daughter, not to instruct, but simply to exist beside her.

Lil Eve didn’t cry.
She didn’t need to.
She understood the message deeper than most mortals ever could.

The silence wasn’t awkward.

It was sacred.

And then, gently, to disrupt the quiet, Vaporeon whispered:

“Would you have befriended him, Lil Eve?”

A pause.
A nod.

And Flareon added:

“We would’ve let him build bug homes in our garden.”

Lil Eve smiled.
Just a little.

-

[Scene - Evoir, West of Neo-Evoir City - Flames, Water, and the Mind]
After the tale of Buggleby faded from the screen, silence lingered, but it did not last forever.

Flareon, Vaporeon, and Lil Eve stepped outside their domehouse atop the cascading glade of western Neo-Evoir City. The sky shimmered in tones of twilight, an eternal dusk unique to this region.

Down by the spiraling walkway, voices rose in heated waves.

A family quarrel.
One all too familiar.

At the edge of the plaza stood a sharply robed Galaxian Alakazam, a male of stellar origin and sharp discipline. Psychic/Dark by typing, he radiated logic… and impatience.

“You waste your life collecting junk parts, Kadrabra! Why not refine your mind into real science? A career that matters!”

Opposite him, the younger Cosmician Kadabra, Psychic/Steel, forged from satellite steel and comet cognition, defended himself.

“It’s not junk! I can fix things! I can repurpose, rebuild.”

“To what end? You won’t be respected. You won’t be safe.”

Their argument rattled the small crystals lining the sidewalk.

Standing behind them was Cosmician Gothitelle, Ice/Dark, mother, wife, and muted observer. Cloaked in her velvet black coat and icy breath, she looked on in silence, afraid to interject.

But just as Kadabra's aura flared silver-blue, an oncoming Steel Beam, born of frustration, 

Lil Eve moved.

A whip of Flamethrower Trail snapped between them, parting the emotional storm with living fire.

Then came Surfing Waterfall, a spiraling ribbon of water that splashed from the sky down upon Kadabra, soaking him in its calming cascade.

“Enough...” Lil Eve whispered. “You’re not enemies.”

Galaxian Alakazam's eyes glowed, ready to strike in response, until Flareon stepped in, matching his energy. Flames roared at his fingertips, unmoving but unyielding.

“Do not escalate this. You're still his father.”

Meanwhile, Vaporeon approached the frozen Cosmician Gothitelle with a gentle nod.
She handed her a portable holovid crystal.

“Watch this. You may see your own story… if things had gone worse.”

Cosmician Gothitelle trembled, but obeyed. Her fingers clasped the holovid.

Flareon, flames still humming from his paws, forced the father to watch alongside her.
Lil Eve conjured Grass Vines, wrapped them gently around Kadabra, not to restrain, but to still his wandering mind.

Together, under quiet starlight, the arguing family watched the entire footage of Buggleby’s fall.

And when it ended…

No words were spoken for several minutes.

Cosmician Kadabra bowed his head.

“Maybe I don’t want to escape into junk collecting... but to help others fix what they throw away.”

Galaxian Alakazam breathed heavily, then looked to his wife, his son, then down at his own trembling hands.

“Maybe… I was afraid. Afraid he’d suffer like I did. But I never saw he just wanted to be… whole. I can still support that. Gently.”

Cosmician Gothitelle, holding back tears of cold vapor, finally stood straight and stepped forward.

“Then do it. Support him. Encourage him. Guide, don’t command. We do this together.”

The family stood closer now. Still awkward. Still cracked. But no longer breaking.

-

[Scene - Diamond-666, Present Day - The Sunless Lab]
On the gray-blue surface of the battle-worn planet of Diamond-666, inside the Peace Archives Tower, a different figure read from the past.

Professor Junipa, a woman in her late 40s with streaks of white in her hair and wisdom in her voice, she's a lab coated human with pencil skirt and glasses, stood in silence over a dusty capsule labeled:

“Buggleby - Suicide Archive - 97-SS-Class Clearance”

She read the note.
All of it.
Quietly.
Without blinking.

Then she turned toward the comms window, which revealed the sunlight of the local system reflecting off a trade vessel inbound from NFT777-Enefftia.

It had been one year since she signed the Poké Ball Abolition Act.
She had replaced containment with partnership.
Captivity with care.

Her voice echoed softly into the recorder:

“Your pain changed our path, Buggleby.
I wish you could’ve seen what your legacy really became.
Not containment.
But caution.
Not fear.
But reform.”

She set the note back in its vault and locked it once more.

Far above her, the satellite relays beamed the newest laws across the system.

-

[Scene - Neo-Evoir City, Evoir, After the Argument Calmed]

In the heart of Evoir, a young psychic/steel-type Cosmician Kadabra polished his first handmade repair drone, with his mother smiling nearby, and his father watching, silent but proud.

As dusk deepened and quiet returned to the neighborhood, Cosmician Kadabra busied himself behind the family’s workshop alcove, sorting through old scraps and refit tech. Amid tangled wires and rusted plating, his hand brushed against something odd, three small sticks wrapped in aged tape, tagged with fading hazard symbols.

He squinted. “...Dynamite?”

Turning to his father, now seated nearby with a warm cup of cosmic tea, he held them up.

“Hey… is this stuff safe to experiment with?”

Galaxian Alakazam stared at it, his brows lifting in alarm.

“No. Absolutely not. Those are chemically unstable and pre-date our current safeties. Do not touch the fuses.”

There was a time when Cosmician Kadabra would have argued. Would have rolled his eyes. Would have said you’re just overreacting again.

But not today.

“Alright. Got it. I’ll dispose of them the right way.”

He smiled faintly as he packed them safely into an isolation container.

“Guess even imperfect parents still know dangerous stuff when they see it.”

Galaxian Alakazam chuckled, nodding in approval, both at the caution and the wisdom.

Behind them, Cosmician Gothitelle emerged from the porch with a datapad, waving it like a mother proud of her trivia.

“Actually, if you do want to know what kind of junk’s secretly explosive, Cosmician Sandslash has an entire stream series called ‘Boom or Bunk’. He’s reviewed all sorts of weird old tech. I’m a paid subscriber, by the way.”

Cosmician Kadabra blinked.

“Wait, you watch streamers?”

“I don’t just watch, I participate in the monthly Q&A.”
She winked. “You should too. If you’re gonna work with salvaged tools, learn from someone who knows which ones can vaporize your eyebrows.”

He laughed, real, unforced laughter, for the first time in days.

“...Yeah. That sounds fair.”

As they returned indoors, the repaired family felt lighter somehow.
Not perfect.
But healing.

And far away, in a corner of Evoir’s digital sky, Cosmician Sandslash’s next episode thumbnail lit up:

"Tonight on Stream: 3 Items You Should NEVER Use Without Goggles - One of Them Is ALIVE."

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Ch 67 : Temperature Bender Silliness

[Scene: VBend Simulation – “Gentry Mansion: Maid & Butler Edition”]

The digital air shimmered as Vaporeon, eternal maid of Evoir, logged into the VBend chamber. The system loaded her in, except this time, not as herself. Not quite.

She stood tall in a crisp butler uniform, tailored to her aquatic curves, giving off a poised, masculine aura. Her arms, broad and well-formed, gleamed under the simulated light as she rolled her sleeves and flexed with quiet confidence.

A moment later, her partner phased in. Flareon, the ever-dutiful immortal butler, now materialized in a lacey, monochrome maid outfit, head slightly tilted, a frilly cap balanced atop his messy orange hair. He blinked, voice shy and soft as chiffon.

“I-I suppose I’ll wear this today,” he said, unusually meek. “Might as well commit, right…?”

Vaporeon chuckled deeply, walking over and sliding a strong arm behind his knees.

Before Flareon could react, she lifted him with ease, one arm beneath his legs, the other supporting his back. A full butler-carry.

“D-dear!” he gasped, cheeks flushed. But then… a giggle. Soft, musical, and wholly feminine.

She grinned with masculine pride. “Told you I’d carry you no matter the universe.”

And like that, they stayed there, kissing in the virtual sunbeams, tangled in that role-reversed tenderness for three peaceful in-game hours.

-

[Scene: The Next Morning – VHumanMon Login Chamber]

The avatars reloaded, new platform, new world.

Vaporeon entered first, materializing as a human woman with a flowing blue ponytail, sleek figure, and athletic poise. She stretched out her arms and picked out a cheerleader outfit, complete with pom-poms and a confident smirk.

Flareon followed, this time as a modestly toned human man with pointy red-orange hair. He browsed the presets with a thoughtful squint before settling on the quarterback uniform, classic reds with padded shoulders.

“It’s been a while since we did these outfits,” he noted.

“I still remember how to lift a quarterback,” Vaporeon teased.

Before he could react, she swooped in again. With perfect human muscle memory, she bridal-carried him across the locker room zone. He let out a brief sound of surprise, then smiled.

“I’m never too heavy for you,” he whispered, relaxed in her arms.

“Never...” she replied, her voice low and steady. “Even in this world, I’ll always carry you.”

They walked on through the stadium-themed starting zone like that, cheerleader carrying quarterback, neither ironic nor comical. Just two immortals weaving love through the shape of every world they entered.

-

[Scene: Poketopia – Neo-Evoir City, Shallow Lakeside]

The sky above Neo-Evoir City glowed in soft amber as the sun began its descent, casting long reflections over the tranquil shallow lake that wound through the central park of Poketopia. The water shimmered like polished glass, disturbed only by ripples from Vaporeon's graceful steps.

In her arms, Flareon rested calmly in butler fashion, arms lightly draped around her shoulders, his tail flicking in playful sync with her gait. She held him bridal-style, just as they often did in their cherished VR games, maid carrying butler, but now in quiet real-world serenity.

The lake was shallow enough to cross, but Vaporeon insisted on carrying him.

“You walked all day,” she had said. “Let me take you the rest.”

But halfway through, a sudden blast of cold struck the lake’s surface. A shimmering mist, followed by a sudden crackle of ice magic. The water around Vaporeon's legs abruptly froze, up to her thighs. The motion halted. The prank had backfired.

“Ninetales…” Flareon mumbled under his breath, sensing who was responsible.

From the treeline, a faint giggle vanished behind a snowy tuft.

Still cradled in her arms, Flareon’s inner heat aura began to radiate gently. The warmth pulsed in waves, not furious or flaming, but steady like a hearth in winter. The ice began to melt, drop by drop, his ambient warmth freeing her limbs without her needing to struggle.

She smiled as she looked down at him. “I guess I’m the one being carried now.”

He looked up at her, smile soft and unguarded. “I’ll always melt you out. You carry the weight, I carry the fire.”

The ice fully dissolved. The rippling water returned, flowing beneath them, the surface echoing with soft waves, like a torch carried on tide, love enduring even in elemental mischief.

And so she continued walking, her arms around her eternal partner, the tide carrying her flame, the flame keeping her free.

-

[Scene: Evoir – Temperature Calibration Lab, Neo-Evoir City]

The sleek, glass-walled temperature lab shimmered under the glow of crystal-lit panels, a high-tech facility rarely used for competitions, until now.

Vaporeon stood in the center, clipboard in paw, tail swishing as she wore a mock-serious expression. A digital thermometer floated beside her, calibrated precisely to 0.000001 accuracy. She glanced at the two buckets in front of her, one gently boiling, the other crusted in hoarfrost.

Across from each other stood the elemental duelists:
Flareon, exuding intense radiance with the playful grin of a boy ready to show off.
Alolan Ninetales, dignified yet determined, the tips of her snowy fur glowing faint blue.

“I apologize again for the lake stunt.” Ninetales said, bowing her head lightly. “I didn’t expect it to freeze that suddenly.”

“No hard feelings.” Flareon smirked, “But now we settle it... the 69°C challenge.”

“Accepted!” she replied coolly, her breath visibly frosting the air.

-

[Moment Later – Calibration Round Begins]

Flareon stepped forward first, conjuring a precise burst of flame into the water bucket. It bubbled steadily as he held his paw over it like a chef monitoring soup. After a few seconds, he stepped back with confidence.

Alolan Ninetales approached hers, encasing it with a swirling blizzard spiral. The ice crept inward like petals folding in reverse, until the center crystallized to absolute stillness.

Vaporeon carefully dipped the thermometer into Flareon’s bucket. The display blinked for a moment, then read out:

69.696999°C

Flareon puffed his chest proudly.

Then she turned to Ninetales’ frozen bucket. The probe pierced the surface like glass cracking under light pressure. A moment later:

–69.666999°C

A brief pause.

All three of them said it in chorus:

“…Nice.”

They all burst into soft, controlled laughter, Vaporeon covering her face with a paw, Flareon bending slightly with a snort, and even Alolan Ninetales letting out a rare, melodic giggle.

“You win by decimals.” Flareon nodded toward her.

“No...” Ninetales smirked, “we’re both professionals in extreme conditions.”

“Still,” Vaporeon said, clearing her throat and regaining her judge voice, “the real winner is the science of friendship… and math jokes.”

“Boo.” Flareon grinned.

-

[Scene: Death Loop Tablet – Thermal Gauntlet Level]
The air sizzled, crackled, and froze in mad alternation. In a nightmarish simulation of fire, ice, and drowning hazard roulette, Regigigas lumbered forward with heavy, slow-paced leaps. Below him, Sharpedos swarmed in frigid waters, snapping their teeth at anything that dared touch the surface. Above him, flamethrower turrets swung back and forth like wicked pendulums, while ice spikes jutted out from unpredictable directions.

The platforms beneath him were either slick with frost or steaming with heat, often both within seconds. Fire pillars hissed upward. Ice fragments shattered underfoot. The temperature gauge above the screen flickered like a dying signal.

Regigigas cursed under his breath as another fireball nicked his arm.

"Temperature error: 999°C to -999°C detected."
"Pain level adjusted."

“Of course it is,” he muttered, ducking just in time before an ice spike grazed his back.

-

[Scene: Streaming Room – VBend Hub, Neo-Evoir Orbit]
Cosmician Sandslash, wearing his full streamer headset and plush gaming chair, watched intently, one paw dipping into hot soup, the other scooping ice cream. The thermal contrast didn't bother him, it was on theme. His overlay chat buzzed as viewers laughed, sent tips, and threw emojis of fire and snowflakes.

Chat: “He’s dodging like a toaster in a blizzard LMAO”
Chat: “Can Sharpedo bite through legendary plates?”
Chat: “WHAT’S THIS TEMPERATURE RNG???”

“LET’S GOOOOOO, GIGAS!” Sandslash shouted with a grin. “This is your redemption arc! Don’t let the Sharpedos get your ankles again!”

As he prepared his next comment overlay, VBend suddenly activated, syncing his avatar live on-stream. Sandslash blinked, and in an instant... 

He appeared on the virtual side screen as a girl in a cropped “Gamer Girl” T-shirt and sparkly skirt, complete with bold eyeliner and sassy pose. The transformation was seamless.

He tilted his head, looked at the screen, then deadpanned into the mic:

“…Yep. VBend got me again. Genderbent mid-soup.”
He flexed with mock pride. “Still handsome. Let’s stream it anyway.”

Chat exploded.

Chat: “Gamer Girl Sandslash arc LET’S GO”
Chat: “You slay. Literally.”
Chat: “She’s beauty, she’s grace, she’s the soup queen of space”

Back inside the game, Regigigas saw the “Gamer Girl Sandslash” avatar cheering him from a floating screen above, giving thumbs-ups between bites.

“YOU CAN DO IT,” Sandslash’s squeaky genderbent voice echoed.
“Just don’t fall in the soup.”

Regigigas sighed heavily, dodged a flaming platform, then got hit by a freeze beam.

“…I miss being in a forest.”

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Ch 68 : Extraterrestrial Food Run

[Scene: Interplanetary Route – En Route to Div-9K]
Cosmician Sandslash leaned back in his loop-powered space cruiser, a grin stretched across his snout. The spacecraft, shaped like a giant metallic Sonic loop-de-loop, spun violently in a blur of rings and centrifugal energy. The Sonic Space Loop engine roared louder the faster it looped, converting childlike nostalgia into quantum propulsion.

“Alrighty, seven-day chill trip to Div-9K.” Sandslash muttered into his mic, licking a scoop of mochi-styled ice cream. “Just me, my chat, interstellar snacks... and my eternally cursed guest.”

He turned to the side, a secure containment glass tablet pulsed in the co-pilot’s seat, held upright by stabilizing rings and layered protective charms. Inside it: Regigigas, still in his Death Loop Tablet, currently mid-game and very not chill.

-

[Scene Within the Death Loop Tablet – Regi Rush Zone]
Regigigas, with his colossal frame cartoonishly squashed into the shape of a Sonic knockoff, was sprinting through a jagged 2D side-scrolling hellscape. Below: pits of spikes. Above: flamethrower drones. Timer: ticking toward zero.

He crushed a speed boost orb, dodged an anvil, and barely slid under a collapsing wall of magma bricks.

“REGI RUSH: ACT 4 – OGI ONIONLAND”

At the far end of the horizon, his reward and exit bait floated gloriously: giant golden onion rings, pulsing with unhealthy fats and sweet scent illusions.

“GET TO THE ONION RINGS IN TEN MINUTES OR DIE FROM SPACE SUFFOCATION.”
“IF YOU WIN: DEATH BY HEART FAILURE. SOFTER. MORE DIGNIFIED.”
“TIME REMAINING: 01:23”

He grunted in pain as an unexpected spring trap launched him backward into a cryonic wind tunnel. A red warning blinked:

“YOU SLIPPED ON GARLIC GREASE – STAMINA REDUCED.”

“Who built this level?” Regigigas wheezed, struggling to move.

-

[Scene: Back to Reality – Sonic Loop Cruiser Cockpit]
“...Right, chat, he's getting to the onions...” Sandslash said with a mouthful of popcorn, leaning into the camera in his VBend girl form, now with virtual sunglasses and his “LOOP ME HARDER” t-shirt. “If he makes it, it’s a fatty death, not a vacuum scream one.”

The chat exploded.

Chat: “RUN REGI RUN”
Chat: “SUFFER FOR THE RINGS”
Chat: “LOOPED SO HARD HE BECAME HIS OWN FAN GAME”

The Sonic Space Loop passed another moon, looping again.

-

[Scene: Final 10 Seconds – Inside Regigigas’ Game]
He launched off the final hill. The giant onion ring monument glowed with triumphant grease light. Regigigas panted, he could taste the caramelized burn.

5 seconds.

He dove, face first, into the onion ring portal.

-

[Scene: Space Cruiser]
The tablet flashed “SOFT DEATH UNLOCKED – cardiac arrest simulated in sleep mode.”

Cosmician Sandslash nodded. “Good job, big guy. You earned your onion.”

He leaned back, engines humming gently now as they neared Div-9K, stars bending softly around the curved windows. A warm silence filled the cruiser cabin, punctuated only by Sandslash spooning ice cream into his mouth.

“Next game,” he whispered, “Regigigas becomes a cooking papa…”

-

[Scene: Div-9K – Electro Market District, Noonlight Haze]
The Sonic Space Loop cruiser touched down gently, kicking up electric pollen dust from the vibrant glowing plants that laced the walkways of Div-9K. Neon petals shimmered in midair, and delivery drones buzzed overhead like cicadas on espresso.

From the open market plaza, a loud voice rang out.

“Yo! Long time, Sandslash!”

Enefftian Scovillain, a rare Grass/Electric variant of his species with hypercharged twin heads and a stylish utility vest, was carefully unloading a cart of locally grown electro-chillis, handing over a crate to a tall, buff human with kitchen scars and martial bandages: Pizzero, Fighting-type-typed, the battle-chef of Div-9K.

Pizzero grinned. “These’ll light up the tongues and the scoreboard.”

Cosmician Sandslash, still in his VBend girl avatar, waved and jogged over. “Need a tour guide, and you’re the spice trail boss. I wanna see how Div-9K’s eating these days.”

Scovillain chuckled, his electric tendrils flaring with pride. “You’re a customer again, huh? Alright. Let’s start with the Voltage Alley.”

Sandslash nodded, carrying the Death Loop Tablet under one arm like a clipboard.

-

[Scene: Within the Death Loop Tablet – Regigigas: DoughMaze Horror]
Inside the flickering screen:

Regigigas now lumbered through a nightmare-flavored digital maze, modeled after a parody version of Pac-Man. The grid shimmered with sprinkled donut dots, each one reducing his final pain level if eaten. The background was a dissonant lullaby remix, warped like a broken record.

MISSION: CONSUME ALL DONUTS BEFORE BEING DRAINED.
“DEATH GOAL: TYPE-3 DIABETES WITH SUGAR COMA EUTHANASIA”
ENEMIES: GENGAR ILLUSIONS x4 – CONTACT = DREAM EATER

He turned a corner, just as a giggling Gengar illusion phased in from a wall, shimmering purple with psychic residue.

“DREAM EATER ENGAGED.”

The titan's heavy legs slowed. The maze bent sideways. Sprinkles melted into teeth. His head pounded, nightmare loops, personal regrets, and flashes of Saga 3 flashed before his mind. His body became heavy with syrupy dread.

Outside the tablet, a red warning blinked:
[MENTAL COLLAPSE IMMINENT – DREAM SPIKE 87%]

-

[Scene: Voltage Alley – Div-9K]
“Yo, uh, your guy’s getting munched by dreams again.” Scovillain warned, noticing the flicker.

Sandslash clicked his tongue. “Eh, he'll walk it off. The donut ones are kinder deaths compared to the lava races.”

He gently tapped the tablet. “C’mon big guy. You can tank one Gengar bite.”

Scovillain led them past neon spice stands, thunderfruit cafes, and an open-air VR salon.

Pizzero caught up, holding a mini-calzone and flipping it like a kunai. “Hey, if your titan buddy wakes up and wants to die eating, I got this twelve-layer electric lasagna. One slice’ll shut down an elephant.”

Sandslash’s eyes lit up behind gamer girl glasses. “Add that to the mercy meal tier.”

-

[Scene: Voltage Alley Pizza Stand – Div-9K, Afternoon Heat Pulse]
The neon buzz of the market was briefly interrupted by a flustered voice.

Pizzero, wiping sweat from his brow with a fireproof towel, leaned closer to Cosmician Sandslash, who was still cheerfully posing in his VBend girl-mode.

“Hey uh… buddy. Mind turning off the avatar filter for now?”
He scratched the back of his neck, eyes awkwardly darting away.
“I’m kinda… women-shy. You know. Can’t focus when you’re rocking the whole… gamer skirt thing.”

Sandslash blinked. Then sighed, half-laughing. “Fair enough.”

With a flick of his console ring, the VBend filter shimmered off, and Cosmician Sandslash returned to his default male form, broad-shouldered, sandy armored plating polished with a casual matte, and a backpack still hung with energy drink clips.

“Better?”

Pizzero relaxed visibly. “Much.”

He placed an order into the terminal. “Four electro-chilli pizzas, two with double plasma sauce.”

Just then, he glanced at the Death Loop Tablet, which was now perched upright on the table.
The glow flickered… and the screen burst into movement.

-

[Scene: Inside Death Loop Tablet – Regigigas: Pizzero Tower]
Cue distorted jazz horns and clanging pans.
Regigigas was sprinting across an absurdly vertical tower of crumbling platforms and chaotic pizza traps, in a side-scrolling fever dream called:

“Pizzero Tower: Regigigas Remix”
“Your Goal: Get Too Fat To Live. Outrun the Pizza-Tyrant Before He Grates You.”

He ground-pounded through cheese golems, dodge-rolled past pineapple traps, and wall-jumped off parmesan cliffs.

The boss chaser, a terrifying Tyranitar illusion shaped like an overbaked slice, roared behind him, crust ablaze.

Regigigas surged forward, final room, a mountain of pizzas awaited.

He devoured them all, even the anchovy-loaded horror.
Screen flashed:

“P-RANK ACHIEVED – BITTERSWEET DEATH INCOMING.”

His sprite inflated to absurd proportions. The screen gently faded to a soft piano note and a title card:

“Cause of Death: Delicious Overload – Well Done.”

-

[Scene: Voltage Alley Table – Div-9K]
The performance ended. The screen dimmed.

Cosmician Sandslash tapped the record stop button.

Pizzero raised his eyebrows, genuinely impressed. “That was... incredible.”

Enefftian Scovillain whistled, arms crossed. “He P-ranked that? That game made a 900 IQ Xurkitree cry on stream.”

Sandslash stretched his arms, smiling. “Titan still got it. Death with flavor.”

Then came a faint buzz from the tablet, a text prompt:

REGIGIGAS REQUEST: ORDER CELEBRATORY PIZZA – SHAPE: ME
TOPPINGS: THICK CRUST. LOTS OF ONIONS.

Sandslash laughed aloud. “He wants a Regigigas-shaped pizza.”

Pizzero cracked his knuckles. “Then I better make it. You don’t ignore a death loop champion’s last meal, even if he’s got a hundred more coming.”

Scovillain high-fived Sandslash, eyes gleaming. “This is why Div-9K’s the best vacation spot. Even deaths are gourmet here.”

-

[Scene: Voltage Alley – Div-9K Open Market, Sunset Orange Haze]
The scent of sizzling electro-chillis filled the alleyway as another customer duo strolled into view:
Divian Empoleon, a tall, regal Water/Poison Pokémon with sleek navy-blue armor plating, walked confidently beside his longtime neighbor, the graceful Divian Milotic, her long, vine-wrapped fins flowing like silk and eyes gleaming like dew-touched leaves.

The two stopped abruptly at the sight of the Regigigas-shaped pizza being boxed up.

Empoleon (raising an eyebrow): “Is that… meant to be who I think it is?”

Sandslash (nodding proudly): “Yep. P-ranked his own doom in Pizzero Tower. Had to reward that, obviously.”

Before Empoleon could reply, Scovillain sparked a bolt from his fingertips to re-energize the soil plot beside the oven, a crackle of greenish-blue electricity struck the local pepper crop.

Divian Milotic gasped, jumped with a flutter... 
...and instinctively leapt into Empoleon’s arms.

Empoleon (steady, amused): “Still the same reflexes, huh?”

She blinked, embarrassed, as Empoleon gently lowered her.

Meanwhile, behind the counter, Pizzero had vanished, ducking behind his prep station again, cheeks flushed red.

Milotic noticed.

Her eyes widened, a little mischievous sparkle in them, then, without missing a beat, she dove behind a tall pizza crate, whispering:

Milotic: “If he’s gonna hide, I’m hiding too. Rules of mutual shyness.”

There was a short, stunned silence…
Then Sandslash, Empoleon, and Scovillain all burst out laughing.

From behind the crate, Milotic called playfully, “You can come out now, Pizzero. I promise I won’t sparkle too hard.”

Gingerly, Pizzero peeked over the counter, then seeing Milotic still half-hiding, he managed a bashful smile and finally stood up straight.

Pizzero: “Empoleon, good to see you again. One Regigigas Special?”

Empoleon: “Yes, and pass my congrats to Sandslash. That death looked glorious.”

Cosmician Sandslash (grinning): “Most painful heart failure ever streamed. I’m putting it on my channel’s banner.”

Empoleon chuckled, placing the order. Milotic slowly stood too, brushing some imaginary dust off her leafy fins, pretending the last two minutes hadn’t happened.

-

[Scene: Voltage Alley – Div-9K, same location, still sunset-tinted]
The wind whooshed loud.

Suddenly... 
A thudding metal clatter echoed through the square.

A runaway robot, sparking and wobbling, sped past the group. Behind it, a young woman, clearly human, athletic build, dressed in molten-orange overalls and flaming skirt, her flame-scorched ponytail whipping behind her, chased after it.

Human Woman (Fire/Ground, panting): “Stop! Stop, you half-baked weldpot!”

BOOM!

The robot detonated into a small fireball. A metallic leg flew into a fruit stand. The woman, thrown by the shockwave, flailed mid-air... 

Pizzero blinked once, dashed like a fighting flash...
...and caught her bridal-style inches before she hit the bubbling shallow canal (a swimming pool) beside the alley.

The others paused in awe.

Sandslash (impressed): “Yo.”

Empoleon (soft chuckle): “He’s still got reflexes.”

Scovillain (grinning): “Smooth!”

Milotic peeked out from her hiding spot behind the crate, eyes wide.

Pizzero landed lightly on his feet, placed the stunned woman gently on the nearby bench.

Pizzero (quickly, flustered): “You okay? You smell like scorched curry but you’re light as dough.”

Fire/Ground Woman (blushing): “Y-yeah… I think I broke three ribs and my dignity.”

Before she could say more, Pizzero sprinted away again, diving behind the large crate... 

...but instead of hiding beside Milotic, he accidentally dove right into her, knocking them both into the narrow space between boxes and rolling directly into the entrance hatch of his Chillicano pizza ship’s side compartment.

Metal doors shut.

Milotic (inside, faintly): “…I’m not sparkling too hard, I swear.”

Outside:

Sandslash and Scovillain burst into full-on laughter, leaning on each other.
Empoleon tried to keep a straight face, but his muffled snorts betrayed him.

Regigigas, watching all this in his Death Loop Tablet (now playing a Dating Sim game where failure leads to being ghosted into oblivion), laughed out loud for the first time in weeks.

Regigigas (text bubble): “BEST DEATH BY EMBARRASSMENT: UNLOCKED.”

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Ch 69: So Nice

[Scene: Living Room and then Lab]

Alolan Ninetales sat gracefully on a fluffy sofa in the living room, still dressed in her trademark sky-blue sundress that flowed like icy mist. With a half-smile and a wink to the audience, she said coolly, “Welcome to Chapter 69… Nice.”

She stretched out her legs, tail curling with anticipation. “Let’s continue the thermometer challenge.” she declared, elegance meeting mischief.

Soon after, the front door slid open. In walked Flareon, the forever butler, steam gently rising from his fur, followed by his radiant wife Vaporeon, the eternal maid. Both beamed with childish excitement.

On Flareon’s side of the challenge: a bubbling pot of vegetable soup flavored with spicy herbs and roasted roots. As the steam danced into the air, Vaporeon dipped the thermometer into the broth.

“69.9669°C.”

“Perfect.” Flareon grinned with pride, steam puffing out from his cheeks.

On the opposite side, Alolan Ninetales revealed her treat: a delicate glass bowl of fruit-infused ice water, frozen just right to create a shimmering fruit ice cream sorbet. Vaporeon measured the chilled mix.

“-69.6699°C.”

“Nice symmetry!” Ninetales said with a smug tilt of her head.

Just then, the door creaked open again.

Lil Eve, still in her seifuku school uniform, blinked curiously. “What are my parents and Aunt Ninetales doing?” she sniffed the air, catching the rich aroma of veggie soup.

Trailing behind her was her boyfriend, Keldeo, dressed in his neat black gakuran jacket. The two walked over and peered at the thermometer readings.

Together, with a deadpan blink and instant harmony, they said:

“…Nice.”

Vaporeon burst out laughing, tail slapping the tile floor. “She gets it!” she said proudly. “Our girl really gets it.”

Once the soup cooled to eatable warmth, and the frozen fruit sorbet softened just enough, Gardevoir, dressed in her formal policewoman coat, arrived to act as the impartial judge. She tasted both with absolute seriousness.

“Shockingly good!” she finally admitted, licking the spoon with quiet awe.

-

[Scene: HydroPyro Café – Steamy Branch]

Later that day, the vegetable soup was ladled and shared at the HydroPyro Café’s steamy branch, warmed by Flareon’s fire. The fruit sorbet was brought in a frost-lined carrier by Vaporeon and Ninetales, chilled to perfection.

Customers raved. The combination was a “thermal fusion tasting event.”

And in the corner of the chalkboard menu, a playful title was scribbled by Lil Eve:

Chapter 69 Special: Nice.

The challenge had become a new seasonal tradition.

The warm buzz of conversation filled the café as diners sipped steaming soup and spooned delicate fruit sorbet, laughter floating beneath the clinks of spoons and cups.

Just then, the glass door slid open with a ding, and in strutted Cosmician Sandslash, wearing his relaxed streamer hoodie over a flashy vest printed with star maps. He held up his portable cam drone with one paw, waving to his followers.

“Yo viewers, we’re live from HydroPyro Café's Chapter 69 Special... and yeah, it’s exactly what you think.”

Following behind him, Regigigas’s Death Loop Tablet floated in with quiet humming, projecting the titan’s current game. The screen displayed a burning digital battlefield of flaming cannons and frost traps. Regigigas, sluggish but determined, was dodging hazards while solving a live math challenge.

The question blinked across the screen:

| What is √9 × 23?

Fireballs rained from above. Ice beams skimmed the bottom floor. Regigigas had only seconds. He leapt across falling platforms, stomped a fake answer button ("115"), slipped on a slippery tile, and at the last possible second…

BOOM... he landed on “69.”

The crowd inside the café jolted and turned toward the tablet’s screen.

“69!” someone shouted.

The answer confirmed with a green flash.

Perfect answer. Minimal death.

Everyone clapped as a fireball barely missed the titan’s head.

-

Alolan Ninetales, ever so elegantly resting at the dessert counter, lifted her teacup and smirked.

“Fun fact...” she said coolly. “Sixty-nine squared is 4,761. Sixty-nine cubed is 328,509.”

She flicked her tail dramatically.

“Notice anything, darlings? Together, both numbers use every digit from 0 to 9. No repeats. No omissions.”

The café went silent for a moment.

Then, everyone said in unison:

“Nice.”

-

Cosmician Sandslash sipped his fruit-chili soda and grinned to the camera.
“This entire planet just gets it.”

-

[Scene: Outside HydroPyro Café – Steamy Branch]

A cool breeze rolled through the plaza outside the café as the diners inside still chuckled from the Regigigas math moment.

Dragonvee, the radiant daughter of space and timelines, stepped gracefully down the street in her shimmering temporal maid uniform, deep violet with golden clockwork embroidery subtly ticking along the hem. She adjusted her glasses with pride, noticing the familiar auras ahead.

She blinked.

Vaporeon, her eternally majestic mother, was proudly holding Flareon upside-down in a ridiculous flourish, his tails flopping down like a chandelier as his butler uniform stayed neatly pressed despite gravity's betrayal. His cheeks puffed in silent protest, a faint blush beneath his fur.

The moment Vaporeon spotted Dragonvee…

“You saw nothing...” she declared in mock-seriousness, instantly rotating Flareon into a perfect bridal carry, her arms firm and her smirk smug.
Flareon gave a helpless sigh, then shyly nuzzled her shoulder anyway.

-

Nearby on a frosted garden bench, Lil Eve stood up with her seifuku skirt swaying, holding a glowing Frost Print stylus. She giggled, spun once, and tapped the air.

From thin vapor, a perfect ice sculpture formed midair:

- A glowing 69, ornate and translucent.

- Below it, two koi-like fish frozen nose-to-tail in a mirrored spiral, a symbol of playful duality.

The café doors swung open briefly as those inside looked out and saw the masterpiece.

“Nice.” they echoed again.

-

Then, like lightning, Lil Eve revved her Electro Drift shoes, zooming toward Keldeo across the plaza in a charged blur.

“I’m gonna get you, stallion~”

“Wai...” Keldeo didn’t finish.

She pounced, tackling him into the soft grass with a spark-filled impact. With giggling confidence, she kissed him full on the lips, pinning him down with a satisfied grin and frizzed-up hair.

From the Death Loop Tablet still floating near the café, even Regigigas chuckled weakly at the romance slam.

Cosmician Sandslash, still streaming, gave a thumbs-up.

“Chapter 69 still delivering.”

-

[Scene: Regigigas's Death Loop Tablet – Math Doom Arena]

Inside the surreal digital deathtrap, Regigigas was mid-leap between melting ice tiles and fireball cannons. His breath was heavy. The distorted robotic announcer voice rang:

"Solve or Die: sin(69°), Choose your fate."

Four glowing platforms hovered in the lava mist below, each labeled:

A) 0.969

B) 0.699

C) 0.934

D) 0.500

Regigigas, battered but focused, narrowed his eyes.

"No memes!" he growled under his breath, dodging a rogue icicle.

He stomped down onto C) 0.934, the true answer. The platform lit gold. A choir of harmonized Pikachu voices cheered in Latin.

A giant floating Pi-symbol pie descended slowly, glowing with golden crust and raspberry swirls shaped like sine waves.

"Cause of death: Overwhelming delight."
"Category: Trigonom-nom-nometry."

Regigigas grunted with faint pride as he munched away.

-

[Scene: HydroPyro Café – Staff Lounge]

Alolan Ninetales lounged across a velvet bench, sipping from her glacier martini. The projector screen in the corner flickered on, playing archived recordings from the Enefftian sector.

Onscreen, a brightly colored ad played from an unlicensed MMO gacha:

“Unlock forbidden skins for your battle fox now!!”
“69% for uncommon body oils! 6.9% for mythic poses!”
“Now hijacking Neo-Earth’s Play Store with seductive flair!!”

The Enefftian Ninetales descendant on screen did a suggestive wink, then got covered in glitter confetti.

Alolan Ninetales squinted… slowly blinking.

She sipped her drink.

“…Not sure if nice… or legally concerning.”

Cosmician Sandslash, still streaming from a corner, tried to stifle laughter while slowly turning the camera toward her face.

Vaporeon shouted from the kitchen: “Definitely not our brand, don't download that!!”

Flareon muttered: “This is why we check permissions…”

Lil Eve poked her head out and whispered: “...is that your niece?”

Alolan Ninetales: “Not anymore.”

-

[Scene: HydroPyro Café – Lounge, Evening Heat & Chill Hour]

A faint shimmer of psychic distortion spiraled above the projector. Lil Eve, in her crisp seifuku with the ends glowing faintly, narrowed her gaze. Her eyes flared into indigo intensity as she used Psybeam Focus, levitating the offending gacha tape like a cursed artifact. She spun it dramatically.

Alolan Ninetales: “Execute it. No mercy.”

Lil Eve smiled faintly. With a twist of her tail, she unleashed a stylized Pulsive Foul Play, a rippling force of chaotic justice embedded with meme retaliation.

The tape burst midair with a shatter-snap!

The crowd, without missing a beat, roared:

"Nice."

-

[Scene: Still in the café, seconds later]

The snap! sound of the tape caught Flareon off-guard, instincts overriding chill. He yelped softly and leapt reflexively, into the waiting arms of Vaporeon, who caught him effortlessly, bridal-style as always. She didn’t even blink, only smirked and held him tighter.

They paused.

Then, just because they could:
They kissed. 69 times.

Every kiss sweet, slow, and with growing steam, by kiss #28, Vaporeon had shifted into full glow-hug mode, and by #69, Flareon was melting into her.

Lil Eve, leaning with a cheeky fang-smile:

“Nice.”

Next to her, Keldeo choked on his tea, flushed bright red.

Lil Eve (tilting close): “You’re next, Gakuran boy.”

He gulped again. Harder.

-

[Scene: Chronoscene Reflector Room – Elsewhere]

The door creaked as Alolan Ninetales stepped in, still in her timeless sky blue sundress, now looking nostalgic.

Inside, Gardevoir, forever composed in her police uniform, tapped holo-screens monitoring web traffic with digital flame tags labeled:
“porkyman dot com” – Status: Safe filter engaged. Adult verification: passed.”

She glanced at the counter:

“69 visitors today.”

Paused.

“Nice.”

Ninetales approached gently with two carefully packed memory albums. One for Gardevoir.

69 photos of her with Lucario, in quiet moments, battlefield glories, shy embraces at dawn.

And one for herself:
69 photos with Mamoswine, silly snowball wars, summer beach stumbles, frost-bitten cuddles.

Gardevoir touched a photo softly, her lips trembling between smile and ache.

“Nice… and bittersweet.”

Ninetales knelt and ran quiet mental arithmetic, tail tips glowing faintly as the photo resolutions uploaded.

“All resized to fit: 6969 x 6969 pixels.”

A solemn pause.

Then together, like a ritual:

“Nice.”

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Ch 70 : Evoir Shielded from Gamble MOBA Pandemic

[Scene 1: The Discovery]
[Setting: Cosmician Sandslash’s cozy planetary data den, dimly lit, screens floating around him.]

Cosmician Sandslash leaned back in his anti-grav chair, idly flicking through interplanetary game streams. A pop-up appeared, loud and gaudy:

“New 5v5 MOBA! Trade Dividends, Last-Hit to Win!”

Curious, he opened it, and immediately recoiled.

“...Ew. NFT777-Enefftia garbage. A last-hit scam dragon MOBA?”

Onscreen, humans flailed in laggy combat against bots, teammates included. Lootboxes dropped from the dragon like casino chips. It was Humanity Dividend UNITED, and it was everything wrong with gaming.

He hit Record Stream and spoke calmly to the mic:

“Alright folks, this game is shitty. Do not play. It’s all bots, it’s pay-to-win, and yeah, it’s from Enefftia. What did you expect?”

-

[Scene 2: Judgement Room]
[Setting: Chronoscene Reflector Room, polished like glass, runes blinking gently.]

Gardevoir stood in quiet vigilance, overseeing live feed pings across the planetary network. A flag blinked: “Content Report: NFT777 Suspicion”.

With a flick, she reviewed the stream. The name of the game alone earned a raised brow. When she saw the gameplay and exploitative mechanics, she didn’t hesitate.

“Predatory pay structure. Bot inflation. And advertised as competitive?”

She lifted her badge and issued a command:

“Humanity Dividend UNITED: Banned. Interplanetary-wide.”

The badge pulsed blue, and the title was scrubbed from all legal channels.

-

[Scene 3: Regigigas’ Loop Continues]
[Setting: HydroPyro Café, back booth, Regigigas hunched over the Death Loop Tablet.]

Regigigas was locked in another simulated match. A fake MOBA match. On-screen, he moved carefully across a digital lane, alone against illusion bots, all former limited-bot-roster enemies.

He was 1v9, and the win condition was simple: last-hit a fast-moving Rayquaza illusion.

Cosmician Sandslash entered the café and noticed the glowing tablet.

“No… don’t tell me they echoed into your tablet too.”

Regigigas didn’t look up.

“They did. They always do.”

An Illusion Snorlax barreled down midlane, slamming an AOE stun that forced Regigigas to blink-dash backwards. Meanwhile, a Talonflame illusion rained fake crits from above, shouting pre-recorded trash talk like:

“Buy the premium wings to fly faster!”

Regigigas growled:

“Shitty MOBA casino scumbag devs…”

-

[Scene 4: Echo Filter Online]
[Setting: Back room of HydroPyro, Sandslash and Regigigas at a diagnostics table.]

Sandslash plugged into the tablet's audio-echo receiver system. He wrote a new script:
Echo Rejection Protocol v1.0

It filtered game titles and viral phrases associated with Enefftian gacha-bloatware, preventing them from influencing Regigigas’ tablet simulations.

“It’s not a perfect fix,” Sandslash warned, “but it’ll keep that specific garbage out.”

Regigigas nodded.

“I’ve died worse. But I’d rather not die from fake Talonflame ult spam.”

Sandslash smiled grimly.

“Then let’s make sure that era stays dead.”

-

[Scene 5: Chronoscene Reflector – The Unholy Truth]
[Setting: Gardevoir’s monitoring room, soft luminescent rings scanning across floating panels.]

Alolan Ninetales stepped in, her sky blue sundress trailing lightly. Her gaze was immediately drawn to a specific flagged recording on the largest panel. It was the game they had just banned, Humanity Dividend UNITED, but not from archives. It was live.

From the fractured reflection of Neo-Earth, real humans were still playing it.

What they saw next left both speechless.

- A working man, eyes sunken, lost five matches in a row. The stream cut mid-frame, his suicide note left on his desk.

- A teenager, screaming profanity at his mother after a ranked loss. He was arrested after assaulting his father.

- Another adult, pale and shaking, had spent his rent on premium skins. His girlfriend left. He walked onto a train track that night.

- A younger boy in a schoolyard, slamming his phone and screaming incoherently. His classmates filmed it, not understanding. They just called him “the MOBAddict.”

Alolan Ninetales turned her head, tearless but stunned.

“Good riddance...” she said coldly.
Gardevoir nodded in silence. “But Neo-Earth… they welcomed this filth.”

-

[Scene 6: NFT777-Enefftia – Schemes in Motion]
[Setting: A tall black tower lit by spinning gacha wheels, symbols of scamming pride.]

In a private upper floor suite, Enefftian Pikachu sat smugly behind a desk littered with profit charts. Holograms displayed rising engagement, even from angry users.

He looked out the window at a planetary feed showing Gravitation55, where protests called for his execution. He smiled.

“Let them cry...” he muttered. “War makes markets. I’ll replace Rillaboom as general soon enough.”

In walked Serenede, commander of NFT777-Enefftia and a human girl with a conviction for strategy over greed. Flanking her was Enefftian Ninetales, fire/psychic type, elegant and persuasive, and indirectly descended from Alolan Ninetales herself.

“Why the suffering?” they asked in unison. “This isn’t what we built.”

Enefftian Pikachu shrugged.

“Gacha’s just a mechanic. It's the people that lose to themselves.”

But he didn’t say the truth: that it was designed to be that way. He needed Serenede’s credibility and Ninetales’ allure to sell more digital lies. He used them. And they didn’t yet see it.

-

[Scene 7: Evoir – The Boundary of Compassion]
[Setting: Nightfall in the elevated Chronoscene Spire, gentle wind fluttering cloth.]

Gardevoir turned off the feed, looking distant.

“We can't cross timelines or save everyone.” she said. “Only those who step here, or those who choose peace.”

Alolan Ninetales sat beside her, folding a paper petal quietly in ritual.

“Then may those beyond us find wisdom through their pain…
…because if not even the pandemic was enough, nothing we say will reach them.”

They both looked up, Evoir's stars twinkled as ever. Eternal, unbroken.

From this distance, the fire and noise of Enefftia and Neo-Earth were but echoes, fading into space.

And Evoir remained untouched.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Ch 71 : Scam Fallout Dystopia Planets Pt 1

[Scene – Ice Fairy Reflections]
Alolan Ninetales, forever draped in her sky blue sundress, sat once again in the Chronoscene Reflector room. A bucket of icy fairy popcorn in hand, she gazed into the monitor, brushing her fur delicately as the images of Neo-Earth flickered.

“I used to run a little ice cream decoration shop in Pokeplanet,” she told the viewer with a quiet smile. “Low profile, low stress. Mamoswine, my beloved, guarded the cold zones of Poketopia before he passed. And now I’m here, in Evoir… immortal since the start of Saga 4. Funny how life turns.”

She popped another cold-puff kernel into her mouth, then turned her gaze grim.

“And humans… they just keep digging holes deeper.”

-

[Scene – Humanity, Divided by Design]
Back on Neo-Earth, the game Humanity Dividend UNITED had already destabilized social trust. But Enefftian Pikachu wasn’t finished.
Now he added a multi-level marketing scheme, one that rewarded recruiters with fake promises of wealth via gacha skin sales.

The outcome was nuclear in spirit:

- Crime skyrocketed.

- Addiction spread like virus.

- Entire cities rioted over leaderboard placements.

- World leaders themselves became addicted to the illusion of “earning” through play.

And through it all, Enefftian Pikachu wore a smile of cuteness, a false mask, while feeding fake status reports to Serenede and Enefftian Ninetales.

-

[Scene – Enter the Rillaboom]
It wasn’t Serenede, nor her gacha partner, who unveiled the lie.
It was Enefftian Rillaboom, the true general, tired of the whispers.

Seeing the disorder firsthand, Rillaboom took control.
He deployed Enefftian forces and colonized Neo-Earth outright. Humanity, already broken and bitterly divided, collapsed under foreign rule.

Some Diamond-666 exiles, now refugees-turned-friends of Enefftia, watched smugly:

“Told you so, Neo-Earthlings. Elitism never saved you.”

-

[Scene – Turnabout: The Mastermind Falls]
Serenede and Enefftian Ninetales, finally putting the pieces together, realized they’d been used, their creative gacha designs twisted into weapons of war. They leaked the truth behind Enefftian Pikachu’s manipulation.

The backlash was immediate.

General Rillaboom, furious at being a puppet in Pikachu’s plan, turned on him.
Enefftian Pikachu was stripped of rank and enslaved, forced to live among the broken humans he once ruled.

His smile faded for good.

-

[Scene – Viewer’s POV: “Just… What.”]
Back in Evoir, Alolan Ninetales slumped in her seat, snow-flecked popcorn tumbling from her fingers.

She blinked.
Once.
Twice.
Then, deadpan:

“…What even was that? Did reality just unpatch itself?”

She sighed deeply.

“No one in Evoir would fall for that, right? …Right?”

She paused, eyes narrowing just in case.

“Back to popcorn.”

-

[Interlude – The Price of Pikachu]

The skies over Neo-Earth no longer knew sunlight. Neon bled across cracked asphalt.
Billionaires fell to vengeful mobs.
World leaders were executed mid-broadcast.
It was no longer a warning. It was a dystopia fulfilled.

Among the debris of culture and order, even the enslaved began to rot from within.

Buggleby’s parents, once sheltered by false hope, now sat chained to factory rigs, whispering apologies to their long-lost, exiled son.

“We’re sorry… Buggleby…”
They died by starvation, a slow and conscious rejection of the nightmare.

Enefftian Pikachu, shackled beside them, now stared into nothingness.

“So this is what it means… to be a Pikachu in this story.”

He remembered how even the original Pikachu was humbled, aged into a quiet Raichu under Urshifu’s philosophy, choosing death over endless fame.

No thunder left.
Only static.

-

[Scene – Evoir: Fourth Wall Icing]

Alolan Ninetales, now leaning sideways in the soft-cushioned viewer chair of the Chronoscene Reflector room, lifted her gaze as the scene played.

No words for a while. Just popcorn crunching.

Eventually, a soft huff through her nose.

“…Fourth wall acknowledged. Even I didn’t expect that level of downfall.”

She turned to face the viewer again, that immortal serenity flickering into mischief.

“So. Being a Pikachu isn’t the plot armor it used to be.”

She clicked the remote.

“Well played, fate. Well played.”

-

[Scene – Three Months Later: The Unforgivable Grave]

The sky over Neo-Earth dimmed for good.

What took only three months was enough to make the planet unrecognizable.

Factory smoke replaced clouds.
Humans cried not for help, but to be eaten.
And some requests were… granted.

Enefftian Tyrantrum, having long ditched morality for mineral profits, stood atop a scorched tower.
A group of half-starved survivors knelt before him, one mumbling:

“Please… we’re just meat now anyway…”

Tyrantrum shrugged.

“Don’t beg. It’s pathetic.”

He ate them without ceremony.
The digestion powered another batch of mining bots.
Neo-Earth’s core now pumped resources to NFT777-Enefftia like an enslaved heart.

-

[Scene – The False Uprising and the Mistake]

But tyranny breeds resistance.

Gravitation55, long harboring vengeful cephalopod-like aliens, had enough.

They launched an unsanctioned liberation strike. In mere weeks, dozens of human camps were freed.

One alien, wielding a blade of dark ion, stared at the now-praying humans.

“Freedom comes with one price. Kill the rat. Kill Enefftian Pikachu.”

The deed was done on livefeed.
A blur of laser fire.
A stylized, censored explosion of blood.
Enefftian Pikachu was no more.

Cheers erupted…

…until some humans, drunk with regained voice, declared war on the aliens instead.

“They’re just squids! They’ll enslave us too!”

Gravitation55 responded. Mercilessly.

Now, only the supporting humans, those who acknowledged the aliens as their liberators, remained free.
The rest?
Collateral in the next phase of interplanetary warfare.

-

[Closing Cut – Evoir, Still Untouched]

From her icy seat, Alolan Ninetales twirled a candy cane stick in her mouth, slowly.

“Civilization can’t be saved if the survivors act worse than the villains.”

She looked at the viewer again, ice blue eyes never blinking.

“And people say immortality is boring.”

[To be continued...]

Ch 72: Scam Fallout Dystopia Planets Pt 2

[Scene – Interplanetary Lockdown]

In the center of Evoir’s vast cosmos-hub, Gardevoir stood with crossed arms, eyes gleaming like polished pearls under artificial starlight.

“Initiate Operation Silverscreen. Lock all ports. Route cloaking active.”

At her signal, allied planets shimmered, Div-9K, Erosbloom-89, and Heavenly Verdant among them, activating stealth grids so sophisticated they tricked even death loop sensors.

“This isn’t retreat. This is preservation.”

Like an invisible pandemic of madness, Enefftian fallout now seeped across stars.

Alolan Ninetales watched the hidden worlds flicker out of cosmic visibility, sipping her icy tea.

“We really are back to ghosting the galaxy, huh.”

-

[Scene – Return to the Broken Neo-Earth]

Through a secured route, Serenede, now sixteen and more composed, descended upon the ruins of Neo-Earth with Enefftian Ninetales beside her.

They bore tainted wealth, dirty Enefftian money, and gave it freely to the scattered, half-rebuilding survivors.

But the moment some Neo-Earthlings turned their anger toward their own kind, flames of infighting rose again.

“You're just tools of the enemy!”
“She took their money, she’s the traitor!”

A projected forcefield bloomed between the mob and its scapegoats, Serenede, arms spread, her voice calm.

“Enough. I was once exiled too. At seven. My parents were dreamers, communist, idealist, foolish maybe… but they never hated.”

The crowd paused.

Trees were planted later that day.

And at the edge of the diplomatic camps, Octopus-like Gravitation aliens circled cautiously, until Enefftian Ninetales lit gentle blue flames, grilling gifts of fruit and protein for them with practiced elegance.

Charmed and fed, the aliens bowed slightly.

“She should lead both NFT777-Enefftia… and this cursed Neo-Earth.”

But Serenede shook her head.

“I’m still learning. And never point your tentacles at Diamond-666… Junipa lives there. Rillaboom’s not one to forgive.”

-

[Scene – Diamond-666’s Steelroots]

Among red metal trees and industrial skies, Enefftian Rillaboom held Junipa in bridal-style, the fierce but quiet strategist and his long-standing partner, close.

“No more wars reach this soil...” he vowed. “Only trade. Only vigilance.”

An assassin crept through the shadows, an Octopus alien, radicalized beyond diplomacy.

Steel Vines shot outward, piercing the assassin through in a flash of shining blood.

The corpse fell.
The silence lingered.

“Peace needs teeth.” Junipa whispered.

“Then we bare them together.” Rillaboom replied.

-


[Scene – A Goddess Observes]

Back in the wintry observatory halls of Evoir, Alolan Ninetales exhaled.

She watched the latest death through the Reflector’s faint shimmer.

“And there it is. Another body. Another day.”

She curled her tail around her tea, steam mixing with the faint frost of her breath.

“This isn’t ending. It’s just the beginning of a longer fall.”

-

[Scene – The Alien’s Apology and the Corpse That Leaked]

The winds of Diamond-666 whistled between the ruined steel towers where the assassin’s body lay, blackened, twitching, leaking something alive.

A greenish mist curled from the wound.

Rillaboom’s eyes narrowed.

Before he could say a word, one of the Gravitation55 Octopus alien leaders, older and wearier than her kin, floated down and bowed.

“On behalf of my kin… I offer apology. That one was too far gone.”

She raised a vial, summoned sterile barriers, and sucked the mist into containment before the tendrils of infection could reach Junipa’s boot and skirt.

“I ask no payment. Only peace. This death need not become more.”

Rillaboom, calmly wiping blood from his chestplate, replied:

“You sure? I’ll buy that virus off you. Could be profitable in select future conflicts.”

Junipa nearly dropped her sidearm.

“You what, Rilla, this is not a garage sale for bioterror.”

But she sighed, already activating trade protocols.

“Fine. Make it a classified vault transaction, at least.”

“Good girl.” Rillaboom grinned, pounding a vine-sealed data pad into confirmation.

The alien leader floated back into shadow, muttering something in her own tongue, roughly translated:

“...these mammals are insane.”

-

[Scene – Lockdown Lifts, But The Watch Persists]

A month passed. Peace flickered, tentative.

Neo-Earth rebuilt its satellite mesh. Gravitation55 returned to its underwater cities. NFT777-Enefftia remained under surveillance, having lost its craziest commander Enefftian Pikachu to his own schemes.

The Interplanetary Lockdown was lifted.

But Div-9K didn’t play dice.

The moment the gates re-opened, every single spaceport was rigged with virus scanners, nano filters, and verification drones.

Evoir followed suit, strict but smooth.

Inside Gardevoir’s chamber, glowing white and serene, she placed a hand on the dome-shaped Planetary Reflector Core, sensing all traveler pulses.

“We, the immortals, are safe. But others bleed far too easily.”

Her voice was as gentle as ever, yet cold, like a knife in silk.

She turned her gaze to the upper garden balcony.

There, Lil Eve, still tiny and pink-eyed in her bridal-robe state, carried a sleeping Keldeo in her arms.

Keldeo’s dream seemed peaceful.

Lil Eve blinked at the floating signs announcing "LOCKDOWN ENDED."

“Huh… did I miss something?” she whispered.

-

[Scene : Cute Unhinged Wins]
A soft shimmer of frost opened a gate near the Reflector Deck.

Alolan Ninetales arrived with her usual gentle, icy trail, tail flared, aura pristine, a popcorn bag levitating near her left ear.

She raised a brow at Lil Eve, still bridal-carried by Keldeo in half-doze.

“So that’s where you were...” Ninetales remarked, crunching a star-shaped popcorn.

“Four months. Four. You, your little boyfriend, and your VR-addicted parents, Vaporeon still holding Flareon like some floating bride.”

Lil Eve giggled, shameless.

“It was cozy. I heard war happened. So I slept.”

She bounced Keldeo slightly, like settling a plush into position.

“We’re going back in for eight more months. Mom and Dad said we should finish the dream year. It's... safe.”

“Safe is good.” Ninetales said, with a sideways smirk. “Just don’t forget to blink once in a while.”

The winter fox looked out toward the sky, where Reflectors once glared at worlds gone mad.

“Y’know, I’m starting to realize… Evoir has its own version of unhinged.”

She took a slow breath.

“But at least here, it’s cute.”

She flicked her tail once more, then returned to her icy seat to watch the cosmos quietly blink in and out of chaos.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Ch 73 : Eternal Cosplay Wonderland

For four uninterrupted months, reality and VR blurred into one blissful continuum for the immortal family. Within the soothing sanctuary of Evoir’s VR core, Vaporeon never once let go of Flareon, carrying him in her arms through digital dreamscapes while their real-world bodies remained in stasis, comforted by soft, humming life support.

In this boundless playground of themed fantasies and loving roleplay, they embraced new identities month by month, rekindling joy through constant reinvention.

-

Month One – Stadium Spirits: Cheerleader & Quarterback

The maid and butler archetypes were set aside for something louder, wilder. Vaporeon became a confident cheerleader, short skirt, pom-poms, and spirit bursting with every leap. Flareon, her ever-flushed partner, took the role of quarterback, proudly resting in her arms as they executed synchronized field stunts and celebration lifts worthy of a highlight reel.
Lil Eve joined in as another cheerleader, pouncing on Keldeo, who wore a quarterback uniform too tight for his dignity. He went along with it anyway, flushed and helpless in the face of his partner’s energy.

-

Month Two – Wonderland Masquerade: Alice & the Mad Hatter

The scenery shifted, teacups floated, chessboards twisted skyward, logic bent softly. Vaporeon now dressed as Alice, delicate and dreamy, while Flareon was the ever-grinning Mad Hatter, playful and smug. She still carried him, this time over pink tulip fields and spiraling staircases in the clouds.
Lil Eve, now a mischievous, striped Wonderland catgirl, tugged on Keldeo’s coat. He wore a nervous White Rabbit outfit and kept looking at his pocketwatch, but never ran.

-

Month Three – School Fantasy: Seifuku & Gakuran

This time, they embraced a quiet, romantic school-life fantasy. Vaporeon wore a proper sailor-style seifuku, elegant in motion, while Flareon, clad in a crisp black gakuran, remained cradled in her arms as they wandered campus rooftops beneath golden sunsets and gentle sakura winds.
Lil Eve remained distant, watching from afar, already thinking of the next transformation. Keldeo joined her, still a bit awkward in his formal gakuran, but undeniably at ease by her side.

-

Month Four – Maid and Butler, Reinvented

Returning to their original theme, they leaned fully into the dynamic, not out of obligation, but because it felt like home. Vaporeon, in a refined maid uniform with soft silver embroidery, walked slowly through a simulation of an old Evoir manor, Flareon snug in her arms, dressed sharply as a devoted butler.
Lil Eve and Keldeo returned in matching maid and butler outfits of their own, reversed roles played for laughs and gentle affection. It was quieter this month. War outside had faded; peace had space to grow.

-

Now – Pony Forms: Eternal Friendship Patch

And then came the surprise update, a new filter freshly added to the simulation: Lil Ponyta Patch: Friendship Edition.

Vaporeon was the first to transform, her body now a sleek pastel-blue pegasus mare, wings flaring from beneath a fitted maid uniform. Her grip on Flareon never faltered. Flareon himself transformed into a bold orange unicorn stallion, still wearing his crisp butler outfit with a swirl of magical aura around his horn.

Lil Eve squealed in delight as she took on the form of an earth pony filly in her seifuku, while Keldeo blinked in shock at his new appearance: a seapony with both legs and a finned tail, gakuran still somehow fitted to his glimmering body.

“Friendship is Magic?” he muttered. Lil Eve nodded and flopped against him with a grin.

They all collapsed into a glowing meadow, stars blooming overhead like lanterns. For now, they could stay in this world for another month, or another year. Time was kind here.

And far beyond their dream… Evoir remained safe. The outside world didn’t need them just yet.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Ch 74 : Shifting Stars, Peace-Chaos Contrasts

[On Evoir]

In the skies of Evoir, where clouds glimmered with psychic resonance, Alolan Ninetales stood silently atop an ice-sculpted balcony, gazing into the distant arc of space. Her vision pierced the void, seeing what the mortals below could not: the healing scars of Neo-Earth.

-

[On Neo-Earth]

The cursed digital battlefield that had sparked a four-month war, Humanity Dividend UNITED, was finally no more. The game was delisted, its servers dismantled and buried deep within Neo-Earth’s orbit-side quarantine vaults. But not all were satisfied.

Clusters of former players, broken by addiction and ego, still raged across forums and protests, demanding the game’s return as if it were a right. Yet the new world leaders, chosen not by profit but by survival, responded not with further conflict but compassion. Refunds were issued. Mental health centers received funding. The old elites had either fled, been shamed into silence, or faced trials. The age of parasitic digital schemes began to crack.

Instead of funneling resources into artificial scarcity and casino-coded nightmares, space programs across Neo-Earth redirected toward exploration and sustainability. Environmental satellites replaced payload drops. These eyes in orbit now scanned for scamware signatures and economic anomalies, forming a planetary immune system against future digital plagues.

Neo-Earth would never be the same.

It didn’t need to be.

-

[On NFT777-Enefftia, Far From the Ashes]

Serenede, a sixteen years old, had made her choice. Though born on Neo-Earth and once exiled with her family, she no longer called it home. Instead, she remained among the strange geometry and tech-rituals of NFT777-Enefftia, serving as a living bridge between humans and the powerful Enefftian Pokémon.

She had witnessed too much to turn back. She had silenced rioters, taught diplomacy to scorched cities, and soothed angry minds with reason. She had watched Enefftian Pikachu fall and seen the Octopus aliens learn to apologize.

And now, she stood beside Enefftian Rillaboom, the jungle-forged warlord turned uneasy guardian. He had developed a dangerous bio-weapon, born from a corpse-virus nearly unleashed on Diamond-666.

“Never again...” she reminded him, voice calm but unshakable. “Only as a last resort.”

He didn’t argue.

Despite their differences, species, origin, history, Rillaboom respected her. She, more than any war hero or strategist, had ensured that Neo-Earth did not repeat its fall.

Serenede watched the stars alone that night.

Not with fear. But with resolve.

-

[On Evoir]

High above the orbits of the recovering worlds, Alolan Ninetales operated the Chronoscene Reflector, gently shifting its shimmering panels from Neo-Earth to Div-9K. The cursed game that fueled the war, Humanity Dividend UNITED, was delisted, and the planet’s mindset began to heal. Now, Ninetales turned her attention to a world untouched by that madness.

As the light bent through the Reflector, Div-9K came into full view.

-

[On Div-9K - A Life Beyond Gacha]
On Div-9K, Typed Humans lived freely among their Divian Pokémon counterparts, far removed from gambling economies or corporate rot. Peace had taken root, and harmony unfolded in the form of daily joys.

Beside a clear fountain, Divian Empoleon, noble and composed, held Divian Milotic, his Grass/Water-type partner, in his sturdy arms. They watched a lighthearted performance just ahead: Enefftian Scovillain, a retired Grass/Electric war veteran, was putting on a show titled Electric Chili Spectacle. Sparks flew from spicy fruits flung in arcs, some igniting midair, others sizzling out before hitting a safety net.

On the sidelines, Pizzero, a Fighting-type human man with a muscular build and rigid posture, stood with forced calm. His eyes darted between the Scovillain's fire show and the gathering crowd, clearly on edge.

He muttered beneath his breath:

“Alright Pizzero. You’ve been in battles. You’ve sparred in zero-G. You’ve dodged chili pepper shrapnel. You can survive this… as long as no girl comes talk to...”

Then another voice, feminine...

“HEY! Muscle-head!”

The words hit him like a stray punch from Machamp.

It was Foxvy, the Fire/Ground-type woman in a sunlit ponytail and athletic frame, striding toward him in a soft orange sundress. Her confident energy clashed against his flustered nerves.

“You still remember, right?” she teased, flicking her ponytail. “The day I chased that busted robot during the Cosmician Sandslash’s visit, and it exploded right over that pool?”

Pizzero blinked rapidly, sweating. “...You were going to fall in.”

Foxvy grinned. “And you caught me. Bridal style. You looked away the whole time like I was some lava bomb.”

Pizzero scratched the back of his head, turning pink at the ears. “Tactical reflexes…”

She smirked and returned to the crowd, leaving him frozen in place like a statue. 
One of Scovillain’s chilies popped in front of him, and he didn’t flinch, his nerves were already maxed out.

-

[On Div-9K - Typed Romance Zones]
Further across the plaza, Alolan Ninetales’ Reflector focused on the Typed Human Couple Zones, quiet areas designed for date outings and relationship bonding. Most of the couples followed a clear pattern: the partner with the type advantage carried the other in elegant bridal style.

- Blackard, a sleek Dark-type man in a black formal suit, carried his partner Elfynie, a gentle Psychic-type woman in a dreamy pink date dress.

- Snowmanner, an Ice-type man with a shirtless fashion statement, carried his Grass-type wife Leafyla, adorned in a flower-petal inspired dress, her arms around his neck as he twirled her playfully.

- A familiar scene echoed a certain other pair from Evoir:
Froggy, a Water/Rock-type muscular man in a sharp blue suit, confidently carried Foxvy, his Fire/Ground-type wife, who smiled and leaned into his chest, dress flowing with every step.

Foxvy giggled at something he whispered, probably teasing about Pizzero again.

-

[Back on Evoir]

As the Chronoscene Reflector slowly closed its view, Alolan Ninetales whispered, more to herself than anyone:

“Div-9K... truly one of the lucky planets.
To befriend Gardevoir, to be spared the madness, and to live with love as the law.”

She smiled faintly, the light of Evoir glinting off her fur. The contrast between hellish worlds and healing ones had never been so vivid.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Ch 75 : Streams Beyond the Loop

[Scene : Orbit Broadcast and Illusion Warfare]
High above Evoir, inside a reflective streaming capsule, Cosmician Sandslash was mid-broadcast. The ambient hum of satellites drifted in the background while a flickering screen showed a familiar figure trapped within: Regigigas, locked inside the Death Loop Tablet once again.

Today’s torment? A mock military strategy sim, reminiscent of ancient illusions. Onscreen, Regigigas commanded armies of yellow-furred, twitchy-eyed Pikachu-shaped units, clearly projections and not real beings.

“Go on, march yourselves into fate...” Regigigas muttered, sending waves of his illusion forces into fire traps, minefields, and wall-mounted zappers.

His tone was dry, yet gleefully cruel. This was more than a simulation, it was personal catharsis. With every zapped Pikachu unit, he seemed to shed another layer of resentment, mocking their long-glorified media image.

Cosmician Sandslash quietly monitored the chat while sipping mineralized berry tea.

“Guess he's venting again.” he muttered. “Let the titan have his meltdown.”

-

[Scene : Real Games, Real Hearts]
After Regigigas’s illusion war ended in satisfying explosions, Sandslash transitioned into showcasing something far more grounded: a fair and balanced base-builder game.

“Alright, time for something honest...” he announced.

This game, forged by a Fighting/Psychic-type Evoirian Pangoro, was everything the cursed war-era games were not. No exploitative traps. No rigged draws. Instead, players could build, manage, and even show off their worlds with pride. Optional cosmetics were priced reasonably, bought only by devoted fans who wanted to support the dev.

Sandslash displayed his well-fortified steel dojo village, fully built without any pay-to-win shortcuts.

“Took effort, but that’s the point....” he said, zooming in on a meditation garden. “Pangoro really got the philosophy right.”

Once his tasks were done, he switched again, this time to a beloved classic: SteelCraft.

-

[Scene : The Spirit of Steel]
SteelCraft had become a treasured relic of gaming in Evoir. What made it special wasn’t nostalgia, but the legacy it carried. 
It was originally created by Steelvee, the rare Steel-type Eeveelution, born mortal despite having Vaporeon and Flareon as immortal parents.

Steelvee had once struggled with the weight of legacy, never inheriting immortality, but poured all his clarity, balance, and wisdom into one thing: the perfect sandbox creation game, along with his wife Alexian the Persian-like alien. 
That legacy lived on, now preserved by Cosmician Zangoose (male, Steel/Dark) and Galaxian Persian (female, Steel/Poison), a direct descendant of Steelvee himself. They upheld his vision with integrity, ensuring every player got a full experience with a one-time purchase and zero manipulation.

“A real monument.” Sandslash said with pride. “And it still stands.”

-

[Scene : Another Death Loop, Bittersweet Release]
Back inside the Tablet, Regigigas had just been loaded into a new SteelCraft-inspired simulation. The twist? This time, he wasn’t a warlord, he was a miner.

Armed with a chunky steel pickaxe, Regigigas had to gather iron while being chased and challenged by illusionary Garganacl-shaped miners, each wielding their own tools, trying to claim the same resources.

He had three lives.

On the first and second attempt, he fumbled, pierced through by glinting steel tools, pain-coded to the nerve.

By the third try, he finally gathered enough ore to forge a gleaming steel beacon. With immense effort, he activated it and stood in its glow.

Rather than being torn apart again, this time he was incinerated cleanly, without agony, a rare painless death. The screen faded to white.

Cosmician Sandslash paused, then clapped.

“See? Even the cursed deserve a kind end… sometimes.”

His chat agreed, spamming silent applause emotes and steelheart icons.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Ch 76: The Online Hooves That Hold Us

[VR Wonderland - Ponyta filter]

Inside the peaceful dreamscape of VR Wonderland, still under the effects of the whimsical My Little Ponyta filter, the Immortal Four wandered gently:

- Vaporeon as a graceful pegasus mare,

- Flareon as a fiery unicorn stallion,

- Lil Eve as a playful earth pony filly,

- Keldeo as a spirited sea pony colt, his hooves webbed, his tail fin shimmering.

As always, Vaporeon never stopped carrying Flareon, front legs curled securely beneath his frame, her wings occasionally flapping with rhythm to maintain their shared balance. Even in quadrupedal equine forms, their bond, and their carry dynamic, remained beautifully unbroken.

While exploring a blooming forest meadow textured in painterly strokes and rainbow lighting, the group came across two other pony-like figures. Logged in from Div-9K, they were familiar avatars:

- A young earth mare with subtle shimmering stripes across her coat, who held a slightly older earth stallion colt in a bridal carry position.

- It was Dawtiny, the adopted Fairy/Poison daughter of Divian Empoleon, proudly Ponytaified.

- In her hooves lay Brendle, the adoptive Grass/Dark son of Divian Milotic, his expression calm and content as she gently walked with him in her embrace.

They had been in this pose for several hours, logged in for quiet time far from Div-9K’s gentle but structured society.

Lil Eve’s ears perked up. “Hey, those two look familiar!”

Keldeo swirled his watery tail. “Wait a sec… aren’t those...?”

Dawtiny paused mid-step, blinked, and then smiled warmly as she realized who had just stumbled upon them.

“Oh! Vaporeon, Flareon… and Lil Eve! Keldeo too? I remember you all, from our visit to Evoir!”

Brendle tilted his head, looking at Vaporeon’s wings and hooves. “You’re still carrying him, huh?” he chuckled softly.

Flareon raised a hoof as if to wave, but Vaporeon tucked him tighter into her chest. “You bet she is,” Flareon murmured with a proud blush.

The groups reunited under shimmering dream trees. As they rested, they caught up gently, memories from Evoir, glimpses of Div-9K’s peaceful progress, and the quiet, shared understanding that in times of peace, holding the ones you love was reason enough to remain logged in a little longer.

-

Despite the wild transformations brought on by the My Little Ponyta filter, the familiar uniforms gave it all away.

- Vaporeon, the pegasus mare, wore the refined flow of her maid outfit, delicately adapted to equine form, frills fluttering with every wingbeat.

- Flareon, regal even as a unicorn stallion, bore the dignified lines of his butler uniform, his collar and cuffs still sharp despite the pastel dreamscape.

- Lil Eve, as a spirited little earth filly, had her schoolgirl seifuku fitted perfectly to her smaller frame.

- Keldeo, the sea pony colt, rocked his tiny gakuran, adapted for aquatic gallops and floating glides.

These touches made them instantly recognizable to Dawtiny and Brendle, whose own equine forms wore casual but coordinated spring attire, a sign of their close bond, but also their mortal grounding.

The group shared warm, nostalgic chatter beneath a dreamtree blooming with virtual petals. Laughter filled the filtered air, until Dawtiny glanced at her in-game status and sighed with a small, theatrical pout.

“Dinner call from Div-9K base. Our mortal bodies still run on mortal bellies.”

Brendle chuckled, adjusting himself upright from the carry. “Fair enough. Though… I could’ve stayed like this all evening.”

Dawtiny smirked, nuzzling his mane. “You’ll be back in my hooves after dessert.”

Vaporeon smiled softly, still carrying Flareon. “Enjoy it. We’ll be here.”

As the Divian couple gracefully logged out, leaving behind softly twinkling light trails, the Immortal Four remained. Time, after all, held little power over them here.

Keldeo swam a small circle midair. “So… want to explore the bubble valleys next?”

Lil Eve raised a hoof, energetic as ever. “Only if Mama does a twirl while carrying Papa again!”

Flareon folded his front legs confidently. “She always does.”

Vaporeon just smiled… and with a beat of her wings, lifted them all forward, back into the dream.

-

[VR Wonderland - Sea Palace]

Within the crystal-domed splendor of the Sea Palace Map, cascading light fell like ripples through water. Vaporeon, ever graceful in her pegasus maid form, held Flareon close in her front hooves as they soared between softly glowing archways of coral and pearl.

Flareon shifted slightly in her embrace, giving a faint chuckle. “Every palace feels like a honeymoon suite when you carry me like this.”

“Then I chose the right wings.” Vaporeon replied playfully, nuzzling his snout.

But the mood turned gently curious as they rounded a bend and spotted a secluded balcony framed in flowing kelp curtains.

There stood Dragonvee, their draconic daughter, now Ponyta-filtered into a majestic kirin-like form, soft gleam of scales, gentle hooves, and flowering antlers that shimmered like lotus branches. In her forelimbs, she carried someone close: a Verdanian Ponytaified Eeveelution from the planet Heavenly Verdant, known as Verdantvee, a rare Poison/Electric typing, evolved long ago through the exchange path from Div-9K.

The two were resting atop sea-lily cushions, tranquil and clearly deep in closeness. Dragonvee’s eyes were half-lidded, her voice low and warm as she whispered something that made Verdantvee smile bashfully.

Then she looked up, and saw her parents.

Her eyes widened a little, but instead of panic, she gently dipped her head. “M-Mother, Father… I didn’t expect you two here.” Her tone was respectful, if a bit sheepish.

Vaporeon floated down lightly, still holding Flareon. “We were just sightseeing,” she said with a gentle laugh. “Though I see someone else is too…”

Flareon raised an eyebrow with a knowing smirk. “Carrying a boyfriend, hmm? Runs in the family.”

Dragonvee’s cheeks flushed softly, and she nodded, still holding Verdantvee close. “He’s… kind. From Heavenly Verdant. We met through a cross-world festival circuit. I… hope to see him beyond VR someday.”

Verdantvee nodded quietly, glancing between them with admiration.

Vaporeon gave a small smile. “You chose well. Just remember, romance is more than how you carry him. But... carrying helps.”

Dragonvee giggled softly. “Yes, Mother.”

After a polite bow, she turned with Verdantvee in her hooves and gently glided off toward the more private wing of the palace.

As the two vanished beneath the arched waterfall gate, Flareon looked up. “Do you think we embarrassed her?”

Vaporeon chuckled. “No… I think she was proud we saw.”

-

[On the planet Heavenly Verdant]

As Verdantvee logged out of the VR wonderland, the Sea Palace dissolved into drifting data sparkles, leaving behind only warmth in his heart and a slight shimmer in his fur.

He returned to the glowing green skies of Heavenly Verdant, a tranquil planet where nature pulsed with calm electricity and floral mists drifted like dreams. Though still new to many across the systems, Heavenly Verdant had been quietly growing for over 3,030 years, its people descended from Divian Pokémon who settled here via ancient trade routes. Among them were the rare Verdinian Eeveelutions, born from unique evolutions only possible on this soil.

Verdantvee was one such soul, Poison/Electric, with soft fur that carried both voltage and a vine-like fragrance. He walked alone through the crystalline path toward a cozy café lined with bioluminescent ivy. The VR session left him slightly dazed, but mostly... fluttery.

Outside the café stood a tall, elegant Verdinian Lilligant, radiant in a calm, motherly way. Her petals curled slightly with age, but her eyes remained nurturing as ever.

“Back already?” she asked, noticing the sparkle in his step. “Was she carrying you again?”

Verdantvee blushed and nodded slowly, trying to keep his composure. “Dragonvee’s really strong… and gentle. I... like being held by her.”

Lilligant chuckled, adjusting a vine-woven basket of herbs. “You always did prefer the comfy route, little vine.” she teased affectionately. “That VR mare’s got you tangled up.”

Inside the café’s back kitchen, a lively hum and glittery beat pulsed through the comms. There, leaning against a mirror and fine-tuning her mic headset, stood Divavee, Verdantvee’s birth mother. She was every bit the Fairy/Electric spectacle, her pastel hues shimmered like neon stars, and her vocals still topped regional rankings.

Though she was a devoted idol even now, her personal life had always marched to its own beat.

She’d once fallen in love with Boggyvee, a mellow yet charming Grass/Poison Divian Eeveelution who served as her creative director back in Div-9K. Their bond had been electric (and mildly toxic, in the artistic sense), but not the kind meant for marriage.

“It was never about rings.” she’d told Verdantvee once. “Only rhythm and resonance.”

So when she discovered she was pregnant, she left for Heavenly Verdant, where society was gentler, and where her son could grow without whispered judgment. Verdantvee had been only six when they arrived, still a Normal/Electric Divian Eevee, barely understanding why his mother looked sad after long calls with her agent.

Now he was a full Verdanian evolution, but he still looked at her with awe.

After a quick meal and a bath, Verdantvee slipped into his usual butler uniform and quietly retreated to the staff break room. There, with a dreamy sigh, he pulled out a holo-print screenshot: Dragonvee, his VR crush, gently carrying him in bridal fashion by the digital sea.

He traced her outline with a clawed finger, then clutched it to his chest.

“I wish I could be with you... not just in data.”

A warm shift in the room’s energy followed.

From the shimmering entrance arch stepped Gardevoir, ageless and serene, dressed not just for enforcement but also as a gentle traveler. Her gown softly blended with the glowing flora behind her.

“Still the same longing hearts in this world.” she murmured, smiling faintly.

Verdantvee blinked, stunned. “Lady Gardevoir...?”

“I visit when I can.” she said calmly. “The last time wasn’t the first... and it won’t be the last.”

She stepped closer and peered gently at the image in Verdantvee’s paws. “That’s Dragonvee, isn’t it? The daughter of those two immortal Eeveelutions, Vaporeon and Flareon. The one you dream of.”

Verdantvee shrank back slightly, embarrassed, ears flattening.

“I-I’m not even worthy to walk beside her... She’s confident, immortal, a carrier. I just... I just want to be carried forever.”

“And there is no shame in that.” Gardevoir replied kindly. “Some souls shine brighter when held.”

She knelt to Verdantvee’s level and offered a knowing smile. “Maybe it’s time someone helped make that meeting real.”

With a brief flick of her fingers, a subtle psychic shimmer traced across a hidden uplink, one that quietly pinged across systems, setting things in motion.

Love, after all, took many forms.

Ch 77 : Verdant Distress Pt 1

[Scene: After the Wonderland]

Seven months had passed within the harmony of VR Wonderland. Time outside had ticked by much faster, but within that lush virtual dream, Vaporeon, Flareon, Lil Eve, and Keldeo had shared laughter, peaceful games, and unforgettable memories in pastel-styled equine forms. They’d remained logged in longer than expected, perhaps because no pain or politics dared intrude there.

Now, blinking into the bright physical world once again, the quartet stepped out from the VR stasis pods, greeted by light, air, and gentle concern.

It was Dragonvee who met them first, her maid uniform slightly wrinkled from pacing. Her expression was not one of joy, but anxiety.

“There’s trouble...” she said, voice trembling. “In Heavenly Verdant.”

The name alone snapped Flareon and Vaporeon to attention. Their daughter’s tone spoke volumes beyond the words.

“A rogue bandit, an Enefftian Meganium, female, Grass/Ground, snuck onto the planet and caused localized quakes. She’s been scamming gentle residents by pretending to be a fortune teller with ‘soil blessings.’” Dragonvee wrung her paws. “But... she’s taken Verdantvee hostage.”

That last line broke any remaining calm in her voice. The other immortals listened intently, Gardevoir already adjusting her coat, Alolan Ninetales closing her eyes to tap into her Chronoscene Reflector, tuning their ship’s arrival window.

“I’ll show you everything...” Dragonvee insisted. “Please... help me save him.”

-

[Scene: Verdant Dangers]

On Heavenly Verdant, lush foliage swayed nervously as underground tremors rolled like uneasy whispers. Deep in a cave lined with cracked crystals and upturned roots, Verdantvee lay tied with electric-proof vines, still in his butler uniform, bruised and shaken.

He was particularly vulnerable to seismic pulses, his Poison/Electric body short-circuited easily under pressure, and he’d collapsed the moment a tremor struck.

Hovering nearby, the Enefftian Meganium loomed with a crooked smirk. She was clearly no native. Her body bore asymmetrical scars and markings typical of NFT777-Enefftia’s lawless zones, where banditry and "disaster mimicry" were once common scams.

“You're softer than the leaves here...” she scoffed at Verdantvee, dragging a jagged vine staff across the ground to conjure another tremor.

Elsewhere, Divavee darted through flowering alleys and crystalline walkways, dressed still in her idol skirt and headset. Her mic had been turned off. There was no time for song, only a mother’s frantic search. Her son’s scent had vanished after the third quake, and her heart had been pounding since.

“She took him... underground...” she muttered, voice nearly cracking.

The townsfolk whispered rumors of a cursed tremor-bringer, a stranger from afar. She didn’t need confirmation. She knew who it was.

Back in the hidden cave, the Meganium hissed under her breath. “They threw me out of Enefftia like garbage. Just for rattling a few cities. That Enefftian Ninetales couldn’t handle real power.”

Her tone dripped with disdain. She hadn’t forgotten being exiled. She hadn't forgiven it either.

-

[Scene: Arrival of the Immortals]

The Verdantian docks shimmered with aura as a sleek, time-piercing vessel touched down without delay. The Chronoscene Reflector had done its work well, Alolan Ninetales guided their entry perfectly, as always.

From the ship emerged the familiar figures:

Gardevoir, polished in her immortal police uniform, eyes sharp and calm.

Flareon, cloak swaying with his confident stride.

Vaporeon, her eyes sharper than ever, tail twitching with quiet fury.

Alolan Ninetales, already analyzing the quake zones.

And lastly, Dragonvee, hurrying ahead in her maid uniform.

They were not alone.

Groundvee, Dragonvee’s younger brother, had come prepared. Wearing his clean white doctor’s coat, he held a handheld seismic reader with a confident grip.

“Her quakes aren’t random,” he muttered. “She’s using artificial patterns to mask her location, but not well enough.”

He activated the tracker and pointed down a mossy slope near the outskirts of the café sector.

“Multiple shortwave bursts. Northeast quadrant. Cave system under the old Ivy Springs.”

Flareon smirked. “Then let’s treat this like a dungeon.”

The group followed Groundvee like a search dog through twisted, glowing vines and cracked walkways. Even as tremors shook loose petals and dust, none of the immortals faltered.

Dragonvee gripped her skirt tighter. “Verdantvee, please hold on.”

-

[Scene: Seduction and Rescue]

Beneath the shimmering ivy-laced earth, the hidden chamber opened up like a breathless wound. Verdantvee lay helpless, still bound in vines, his breath shallow and face flushed, partly from stress, partly from something more humiliating.

The Enefftian Meganium loomed closer, her tone slithering like vines through soil. “Such a gentle face... soft and weak. Why serve others when you could be kept?” Her Ground-type aura surged with manipulative heat, intent laced in her claws.

But then, 

A blur of violet and pink stormed in.

“Don’t touch him!” shouted Dragonvee, her maid uniform smudged by earlier quakes, eyes ablaze.

With the speed of a comet, she charged, tackling Meganium aside with enough force to send her tumbling against the cave wall. The illusion of seduction shattered instantly.

“Verdantvee! I’ve finally found you, not like this, but still...” she gasped, cutting his bonds with her claws and lifting him effortlessly into a bridal carry.

He blinked, stunned at her strength and presence. “Dragonvee... it’s really you...”

Their eyes met, and without hesitation, Verdantvee leaned in and kissed her, sweetly and sincerely, his face pressing against her cheek mid-carry.

It was brief. It was real.

But not quiet.

A violent tremor erupted beneath them as Meganium, recovering, slammed the ground in a rage. The floor collapsed, dragging Dragonvee and Verdantvee deeper into the cavernous fault below with a landslide of stone and roots.

-

[Scene: Descent of the Immortals]

Above, Groundvee had just caught up. Seeing the collapse, he scanned with trembling paws.

“They fell, hold on!” he barked, flinging ropes down the opening. “Tunnel’s stable for now. Follow me!”

One by one, the immortals descended with practiced ease:

Groundvee, first down, eyes locked on the tremor readings.

Gardevoir, teleporting in flashes of moonlight, coat still crisp.

Alolan Ninetales, gliding on frost-imbued stones.

Flareon and Vaporeon, trailing behind, a few seconds slower.

In the depth of the lower cavern, the battle was already underway.

Groundvee unleashed a targeted seismic pulse, a signature counterquake tuned to disrupt foreign quaking patterns. It hit its mark. The Meganium stumbled, her limbs briefly paralyzed by the interference.

That was Gardevoir’s cue.

She reappeared behind Meganium in a flash, whispering, “You’re done.”
Moonblast, direct hit. The glow erupted, knocking Meganium back. She groaned, trying to lift herself.

But then came the frost.

A sheet of icy air swept through, Alolan Ninetales had arrived, her breath a glacial mist. Meganium froze in place, encased in elegant but unrelenting frost.

The bandit’s eyes widened. “Ninetales... again?!”

Alolan Ninetales stepped forward calmly. “You mistake me for my descendant...” she said coldly. “But I carry her will.”

Meganium’s pupils shrank. With that, Gardevoir clamped cuffs of glowing psychic energy over her. The scammer’s rampage was over.

-

[Scene: Bittersweet Discovery]

Moments later, Vaporeon and Flareon arrived, ready for a fight, but the dust had settled.

Flareon looked around. “Where are the kids?”

Groundvee adjusted his tremor scanner, pausing when he spotted something unusual through an aura trace.

“They’re not far. Wait... they’re beside someone.”

Deep in a smaller, quieter chamber, he saw them:

Dragonvee, still bridal-carrying Verdantvee, was kneeling near a shimmering figure of peace and resonance, Bloominian Meloetta, luminous and serene. The immortal being had appeared as if summoned by shared longing.

The couple, even amid the chaos, had hearts that called for freedom, from burden, from fragility, from being breakable.

Meloetta gently touched both their foreheads, and they closed their eyes, not unconscious, just resting. A subconscious yearning echoed around them. Not for death. But for a gentler, eternal love.

Groundvee stepped back silently. “They may not know it yet...” he murmured, “but their call was heard.”

The cave trembled no longer.

[To be continued.]

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Ch 78 : Verdant Distress Pt 2

[Scene: The Gift of Understanding]

In the still glow of the sacred cavern beneath Heavenly Verdant, Dragonvee, still carrying Verdantvee in her arms, gazed up at the serene figure of Bloominian Meloetta.

“I know what this means...” Dragonvee said softly. “But our loved ones, they already know who you are. They’ve met the others before. They’ll understand. We don’t want this to be a secret.”

Verdantvee, face nestled against her shoulder, nodded. “They knew we longed for something more. This... this is peace.”

Meloetta’s gentle eyes glimmered with understanding.

“I only remove memories...” she said, “from those too immature to carry the truth. But your parents... they are wiser than most I have ever seen. As is Gardevoir. They’ve lived beyond grief, beyond possession. They’ll remember.”

She gestured toward a crystalline hourglass altar, the time-glass shimmering with flowing sparkles, its top already beginning to empty. “Step forward when you’re ready.”

-

[Scene: Into Erosbloom-89]

Without hesitation, Dragonvee, still in her maid uniform, took a deep breath. “Verdantvee... are you sure?”

“Your arms are the safest place I’ve ever known.” he whispered.

She smiled, and stepped into the hourglass portal.

A pulse of harmonic energy surged, and with a flicker, both vanished, teleported to Erosbloom-89, the gardenworld of bridal-carry peace.

Their bodies shimmered, their life signatures altered, no longer mortal. Their breath, once fragile, now resonated with timeless rhythm.

And Dragonvee? Her arms, once tired, were now forever capable.

-

[Scene: Contact from Beyond]

In the cavern behind, Gardevoir’s telelink buzzed. A soft voice came through.

“Gardevoir? Mom? Dad? We made it. We’re safe now... forever. I can still call you. I have telecontact now, and it’s always conscious. I’ll stay in touch.”

Gardevoir, pausing mid-flight, slowed and smiled faintly.

Alolan Ninetales chuckled. “That girl... really did it.”

Flareon, though shaken, smirked. “You know... she said this before. That she wanted to find a guy to hold bridal-style... and never let go.”

Vaporeon, tail swishing, added warmly, “Now look where she is, right next door. Immortal, in love, and finally free.”

They all shared a knowing laugh.

Groundvee, standing in silence near the portal, finally exhaled. “I thought she was joking. But... I respect her. She’s earned it.”

-

[Scene: The Embrace of Madness]

Erosbloom-89, sometime later.

Dragonvee now wore a refined immortal maid’s gown, enhanced with living silk that adjusted to her eternal form. Her hold on Verdantvee was gentle, but constant, his butler uniform now styled with eternal threads, suited to a soft forever.

They walked along a peaceful riverbank, shaded with cherry-glow trees and rippling with petals.

Suddenly, she stopped.

Ahead stood a familiar figure: Enefftian Arcanine, once her perverted enemy, now seated calmly with a fishing rod in his paws.

His fiery mane was neatly tied, and a woven basket of modest river fish sat beside him.

“You?” Dragonvee blinked.

Arcanine turned, raising an eyebrow. “Dragonvee?! Is that, oh wow, is that Verdantvee in your arms?!”

She nodded shyly. “I... guess I joined the bridal-carry madness after all.”

Arcanine laughed, stretching. “Well I’ll be. Last I saw you, you were trying to kick me into a ravine. And now? You’re one of them.”

“Yeah...” Dragonvee said, holding Verdantvee a little closer. “And I wouldn’t change a thing.”

Arcanine leaned back, fishing rod bobbing lazily. “I’m a fisherman now. Swore off everything else. Too much earthquake karma. But hey, seeing you like this? Makes me believe this planet might just fix anyone.”

Verdantvee, eyes half-closed, muttered happily, “She always knew how to hold me...”

Dragonvee giggled.

And the river flowed on.

-

[Scene: Surface of Heavenly Verdant – A Tense Reunion]

As Enefftian Meganium was dragged back to the surface by Groundvee, ropes around her ankles and her leafy antennae drooping in defeat, the ground trembled, this time not from her own quakes, but from arrival.

A beam of light shimmered, revealing Enefftian Ninetales, regal and severe, alongside her human companion, Serenede, cloaked and composed.

They approached the group with careful steps.

“Meganium...” Enefftian Ninetales said calmly, “we came not to free you, but to propose your rework.”

Enefftian Meganium lifted her head in confusion.

Serenede added gently, “We believe she can be... reprogrammed. As a rate-quaker, to simulate rare quake tremors for gacha calibration events. It could be a peaceful job. No more scams.”

Gardevoir, wary yet calculating, narrowed her eyes. “And if I say no?”

Enefftia Ninetales tilted her head. “We'd rather not let this spiral into another incident between Enefftia and this planet. Again.”

The immortal’s gaze locked with Alolan Ninetales’. The two foxes stared.

“…That’s my descendant...” Alolan Ninetales whispered aloud.

Enefftian Ninetales blinked, confused. “Huh? DNA trace would need confirming, don’t make assumptions.”

Turning abruptly, she ordered Serenede, “We’re done here. Let’s leave before your family history creates a galactic scandal.”

With a frustrated flick of her tails, she and Serenede teleported away with the restrained Meganium.

“…That got unhinged real fast.” Flareon muttered.

Vaporeon, arms crossed, nodded with a sigh, “…Too unhinged.”

They spoke in perfect sync, then glanced at each other. “We need a vacation.”

-

[Scene: Erosbloom-89 – The Immortal Encounter]

Just hours later, aboard the quiet ship of the four immortals, the group descended upon the tranquil gardens of Erosbloom-89. Groundvee, Divavee, Flareon, Vaporeon, Alolan Ninetales, and Gardevoir stepped out into fields of everblooming roses and mist-lit rivers.

And there she was, Dragonvee, glowing faintly with her new immortal aura, holding Verdantvee gently, lovingly in her arms. His butler outfit had been refined, lined with runes of eternity. He smiled sleepily in her hold.

Divavee clutched her hands together. “My boy... you’re happy.”

Gardevoir, seeing the pair, whispered, “Another successful match. Another vow fulfilled... I think I really am a cupid now.”

Flareon waved with a grin. “There she is!”

Vaporeon gave a cheerful spin before lifting Flareon bridal style again. “Let’s make this a theme today.”

Dragonvee smiled at them, stepping forward. “Meloetta told me something… I can still visit Evoir or even wander the stars. Immortality isn’t a cage, it’s freedom, as long as we don’t abuse it.”

The group nodded, deeply moved.

Just then, they saw another couple pass by, Aqualice, the water-jet maid with sapphire glasses, elegantly holding her partner Burnabon, the flame-hearted butler with crimson hair and ember gloves. The two nodded in greeting, their love as radiant as theirs.

-

[Scene: A Return with No End]

Dragonvee, still in maid uniform now enhanced with gentle Erosbloom enchantments, carried Verdantvee aboard the return ship. His eyes closed peacefully, trusting her always.

Groundvee, silent but proud, gave one final nod.

Gardevoir, Alolan Ninetales, Flareon, and Vaporeon followed behind, while Divavee lingered for one last look at the sacred garden before stepping inside.

The ship launched, bearing the whole group back to Evoir, now with two more immortals aboard, forever bonded, not just in soul, but in embrace.

The bridal carry madness… continued.

-

[Scene: Evoir Newsfeeds – "From Maid to Myth"]

Screens across Evoir, Div-9K, and even Heavenly Verdant flared to life with breaking bulletins from the Dragonlet News Network, one of the most beloved game culture channels in the interplanetary fandom.

“BREAKING: Dragonvee, Dragonlet’s top-tier bullet hell developer/founder and iconic maid of HydroPyro Café, has officially achieved bridal carry immortality alongside her long-distance sweetheart, Verdantvee, during an emotional incident involving a scamming Meganium and a fateful visit to Erosbloom-89…”

The article glowed with radiant fan edits, showered in digital hearts and starburst filters.

Across the fandom, joy erupted.

On a stream panel, the Evoirian Rapidash, veteran developer of the My Little Ponyta visual filter and cult-favorite show of the same name, was seen watching the news. She wheezed hard through laughter and disbelief.

“SHE REALLY DID IT! DRAGONVEE REALLY WENT BLOOMINIAN! That’s it, I’m writing a special cameo for her in Ponyta Season 9!!”

The chat exploded:
“Verdantvee best gentle arms BF!!!”
“Never letting go even in patch updates, wow.”
“Marriage speedrun ANY% WR!!!”

-

[Scene: HydroPyro Café – Back to Routine, Sorta]

Despite the fame, Dragonvee remained as ever, present behind the counter at the HydroPyro Café, polishing cups, menus floating with seasonal combos. She smiled with calm grace, Verdantvee resting in her arms like a quiet, blushing angel. He adjusted his butler sash slightly but otherwise made no move to leave her hold.

“Still holding up?” she whispered.

“Always.” he murmured back, burying his cheek gently against her shoulder.

Bell chimes rang.

Lil Eve walked in with an amused shake of her head. “Well, sis… you really did it. Bridal carry locked… permanently. You one-upped me.”

Behind her came Keldeo, blinking several times. “…You’re really just going to carry him forever?”

Dragonvee nodded softly. “This is what I wanted. I just didn’t know when it’d happen.”

Keldeo chuckled awkwardly. “Well… I’m sticking with Arceus Elixir immortality. I like moving my legs, thanks.”

Lil Eve patted his side. “Same. But hey… we’re happy for you.”

Verdantvee smiled at them both, then quietly added, “I feel safe… here. Even if I don’t walk.”

Dragonvee leaned her head against his. “And I feel… whole. Now I’ll never be alone again.”

The café shimmered with warmth, not just from the tea boilers and ambient glows, but from the air of peace, eternal love… and a little madness.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
