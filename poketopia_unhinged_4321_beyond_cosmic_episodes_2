Ch 61: Utopia Planets by Gentle Small Dreams

[Scene: Planet Evoir – Chronoscene Reflector Room]

Alolan Ninetales stood quietly before the shimmering Chronoscene Reflector, the folds of her pale blue sundress motionless in the still chamber. Her timeless expression bore the patience only a Hourai-blessed immortal could possess.

Projected before her was a real-time view of Neo-Earth, a restless human world, buzzing with ambition and desperation.

Countless mortals, their lifespans brief, continued to point their eyes and rockets toward unreachable galaxies. Futile dreams.

“They'll never make it in their lifetime...” Alolan Ninetales muttered dryly, flicking her tails with faint disdain. 
“Unless they find a way to live forever, which they likely won't. Mortals always waste what little time they have chasing distant specks... instead of saving the ground beneath their feet.”

The Reflector showed fleets of privately owned spacecrafts lifting off, funded by the elite. These ships rarely returned. Some crash-landed. Others arrived at inhospitable worlds, only to be greeted by cleverly disguised Enefftian Pokémon scammers, who lured desperate travelers into ludicrous schemes.

Alolan Ninetales rolled her eyes.

“Still falling for that ‘free utopia planet’ ad? Honestly.”

-

[Scene Shift: Pokeplanet – Orbit Archive View]

With a whisper of wind from her tails, she tuned the Reflector to a familiar star. The Pokeplanet.

At least here, she mused, many still lived in harmony with their environment. But even this world wasn’t free of hubris.

The display now showed a sleek chrome spaceship landing awkwardly on a barren, dust-gray planet.

Inside: two Steel/Electric-type Pikachu astronauts, descendants of Kantonian Raichu and Alolan Raichu, emerged from their pod with confidence, suits shimmering with tech and pride.

They posed dramatically at the hatch. One tapped a button, and the door slid open.

They stepped out without atmosphere readings. Without caution. Without air.

Moments later, they dropped.

“Brilliant...” Alolan Ninetales said, not even blinking. “Spent a year flying across the void just to suffocate on arrival. No instincts. No humility.”

She turned away from the Reflector, her sundress fluttering as her tails curled thoughtfully behind her.

“They’re always trying to escape. But sometimes, the real escape… is accepting where you are.”

She left the chamber, silence lingering in her wake.

-

[Scene: Planet Evoir – Chronoscene Reflector Room, Day 2]

The polished chamber lit softly as the crystalline reflector stirred to life once more. Alolan Ninetales stepped inside with her usual grace, her pale blue sundress whispering with her motion. This time, she wasn’t alone.

Trailing behind her were two familiar figures, Vaporeon, the ever-composed immortal in her frilled maid dress, and Flareon, her loyal husband in sharp butler uniform. They entered with quiet curiosity, their synchronized footsteps the mark of long companionship.

“I want to show you what I saw yesterday...” Alolan Ninetales murmured, gesturing a gloved paw toward the Reflector as it shimmered again.

She brought up the footage of Neo-Earth’s latest batch of would-be star-chasers, rockets taking off into cold oblivion, elite mortals seeking meaning in distant galaxies. Once again, the three watched as another spacecraft landed on a barren rock, its occupants suffocating moments after stepping into a vacuum they never prepared for.

Vaporeon lowered her ears, sighing.

Flareon shook his head.

“Such waste...” he muttered. “If only they cared for their homes like they care for running from them.”

Alolan Ninetales nodded.

“Which is why I’d like you to see something else.”

With a flick of her tails, the reflector’s projection spun, stars blurring into pink and gold, until it steadied on Erosbloom-89, the planet of love and gentler awakenings.

The image focused on two human figures.

Aqualice, a woman with calm, intelligent eyes behind sleek glasses, her long blue hair swaying with every step. A functional maid dress equipped with subtle water-jet wings carried her with ease. In her arms, always, was her beloved: Burnabon.

He wore a neat butler uniform, his short red hair tousled from motion. His flame-channeling gloves glowed faintly as he cooked, cleaned, and tended with quiet diligence, all while resting in his girlfriend’s bridal carry as though it were the most natural state of being.

For a full year now, they had lived this way, joyfully. Immortal not because they sought escape, but because they responded, unknowingly, to a subconscious cry during their time of despair… a cry answered by Bloominian Meloetta herself.

“No dreams of galaxies...” Alolan Ninetales said softly. “Just love, sustainability, and small things that matter.”

Vaporeon blinked thoughtfully, her fin-like tail swaying.

“They water the plants…”

Flareon added with a small smile,

“...and cook for everyone else, too.”

On the Reflector, Aqualice and Burnabon were now helping a group of local villagers harvest rare fruits near a sun-drenched grove. Burnabon, still carried, threw chopped vegetables into a pot with practiced flicks of his flame-gloves. Aqualice laughed and adjusted her grip, careful not to drop him (cannot drop him anyway), while stirring the pot with her barely free hand.

Vaporeon and Flareon shared a knowing look.

In many ways… it felt like looking into a mirror.

“They really still reminding me of us...” Vaporeon said softly, brushing her fin-hand over Flareon's shoulder.

“But human...” Flareon replied, just as gently, leaning into her touch. “And just as devoted.”

The three immortals watched a little longer. No flying ships. No suffocating. Just food, care, laughter, and love that didn’t need to be shouted into the void of space to matter.

Alolan Ninetales gave a rare, genuine smile.

“And that is how you reach the unreachable.”

-

[Scene: Erosbloom-89 – Eastern Hemisphere, Solarvee’s Garden]

The sky shone with soft gold, brushing its warmth over the rolling, fertile slopes of the eastern region. Sun-kissed breeze danced across the layered gardens built into the rocky terrain, each terrace blooming with edible flowers and hardy vegetables, well-cared for by none other than Solarvee, the Rock/Psychic explorer girl.

Dressed in her signature sun visor and practical boots, Solarvee hummed softly as she levitated a cluster of nutrient-rich stones into the soil, enhancing the roots of her crimson-rooted radishes. She glanced up at the sight of familiar shadows approaching.

Aqualice drifted into view, ever serene, her water-jet wings gliding low above the earth. In her arms, as always, is Burnabon, resting with one arm slung over her shoulder, his fire gloves tucked behind his back like a sleeping ember. Together, they landed beside Solarvee, the gentle spray of water wings watering some nearby bushes mid-landing.

“Mind if we help with lunch?” Aqualice offered with a warm smile.

Solarvee grinned and waved them in with a rock-levitated basket of sweetroots.

“You two know the drill. Burnabon, you’re in charge of grilling again.”

Burnabon smirked from within his eternal cradle.

“As long as Aqualice doesn’t try to roast the veggies mid-carry again…”

A gentle nudge from her water jet made him hush with a smile.

Not far off, a third presence watched them with half-hearted interest. Enefftian Arcanine, Electric/Psychic type, and former resident scammer of NFT777-Enefftia, stood by a shallow rock pool with a fishing rod balanced on his shoulder. His fur was windswept, and his manners cleaner now. He’d been stuck here on Erosbloom-89 for over a year… and something had changed.

Gone were the horniness and sales pitches. Now he wandered the coasts as a simple fisherman, trading fresh catches for vegetables and conversation.

Spotting Solarvee, he approached with a grin.

“You know, you’re glowing today. Did the rocks compliment you, or is it just me?”

Solarvee didn’t even blink. With one psychic tug, she floated a few coins toward him and took the basket of glimmering fish.

“Here. Payment in full. Now go.”

Arcanine blinked.

“...Right. See ya.”

He turned and left, tail flicking once, voice muttering a good-natured “You’re no fun” as he vanished into the rocky path back to the coast.

Just as the fish were being placed into preparation trays by levitating stones, another pair of immortals floated down gently beside the garden wall.

Seifuku Woman and her beloved, Gakuran Man, an ancient couple of unfathomable age, their love having lasted 2.5 billion years, waved warmly. As always, she carried him in bridal fashion, and he rested comfortably as if it were second nature. Which, by now, it was.

“Still gardening, Solarvee?” Seifuku Woman called out.

“Still carrying him?” Solarvee quipped back with a grin.

The group laughed as they set up the long lunch table under the flowering sunbramble tree. Friends reunited, comfort as eternal as the sunlight on this planet.

-

[Scene Shift: Planet Evoir – Chronoscene Reflector Room]

The ethereal crystals of the chamber glowed faintly as the latest scene played: gardens, laughter, couples held in arms, eternal peace.

Vaporeon, still in her maid dress, leaned gently forward with a sparkle in her eye, and, without warning, scooped Flareon into her arms again.

“I’m not letting you go the rest of the day...” she teased, adjusting her hold just enough to make it snug.

Flareon, dressed in his butler uniform, sputtered.

“H-Hey! This isn’t part of the...!” He folded his arms and turned his head, blushing.
“...Whatever. Not like I hate it or anything.”

Vaporeon smirked.

“Tsundere confirmed.”

The chamber doors opened with a soft tone, and Gardevoir, still aglow with authority and wisdom, stepped in, her psychic presence mingling with the warmth of the room. She looked around at the joyful mischief of her fellow immortals and at the peaceful replay of Erosbloom-89's surface projected above.

She crossed her arms, satisfied.

“This is what I fought for...” she said calmly. “A solar system where dreams stopped being toxic and started becoming gentle.”

The others nodded, knowing full well: it wasn’t just peace they’d built.

It was a future that no one needed to escape from.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Ch 62: Ingenius Math Descendants of Ninetales

[Scene: Pokeplanet – Present Day, 6.9 Million Light Years from Evoir]
Location: Poketopia (yes, still called that)

Time has pushed forward, billions of years since the golden eras of Ho-Oh’s miracles and the reign of legendaries. The rebirths have ended. True legendaries and mythicals now belong only to the history scrolls. The last of them perished over 2 billion years ago, precisely 390 years after the events of Saga 4.

And yet, Poketopia still stands.

No longer a tourist hub, it is now a fortified, high-security city-state where caution rules policy. After millennia of chaos, it became clear: no divine phoenix would come to undo mistakes anymore.

But hope doesn’t always need revival.

In the educational district on the southern edge, a dual-typed Eeveelution, Fire/Water-type, clad in shimmering Heatran-plated scales, stood at the front of a dome-shaped youth center. Her tail curled neatly, steam rising softly from the contrast of fire and water as she lectured calmly, a holo-slate levitating before her.

This was Heatranvee, descendant of Vaporeon and Flareon, born of Poketopian roots and the gentle principles they’d passed on.

Two young students sat before her, still trembling a little.
A Ground/Dark-type Neonian Piloswine, shaggy and uncertain, and beside her, a more delicate-looking Ice/Psychic Neonian Braixen with crystalline ears and a troubled gaze.

They were cousins, descendants of Greninja x Delphox and Mamoswine x Alolan Ninetales. Despite their powerful bloodlines, their spirits had faltered.

“Our math exam grades dropped off a cliff…” Neonian Braixen mumbled, nearly tearing up.
“We tried to memorize everything, but it just wouldn’t stick.”

Neonian Piloswine nodded slowly, eyes dim.

Heatranvee gave them a patient look, then used her tail to tap the holographic display.

“Because memorization alone isn’t learning...” she said firmly. “You didn't understand the why. That’s the root of good thinking, something more important than any revival.”

She opened a practice exercise not from the exam but from their daily lives, counting soil acidity ratios, predicting steam pressure curves.

Slowly, their eyes began to light up.

Behind them, a wall plaque quietly displayed names of founders and moral pillars: Vaporeon. Flareon. Lil Eve. Keldeo.

Their legacy lived on, if not in miracles, then in small victories.

-

[Scene: Planet Evoir – Chronoscene Reflector Chamber]

The glowing panels cast soft illumination across the round crystal platform. Three immortals sat together, watching the distant feed from Pokeplanet: Alolan Ninetales, ever elegant in her light blue sundress; Vaporeon, tail lazily wrapped around Flareon’s; and Flareon, flopped in her arms again, being quietly carried without protest.

The room was peaceful... until a sigh broke the silence.

“Why is my lineage so mentally fragile sometimes…?” Alolan Ninetales muttered, eyes drifting away from the screen.

“Maybe it's all those brains and no chill...” Flareon shrugged.

Vaporeon poked him in the side.

“Hey. Be nice.”

The doors slid open with a cheerful hum, and Lil Eve floated in like a breeze, still dressed in her iconic schoolgirl seifuku, immortal eyes shining like stars.

“Saw the whole thing already...” she chimed. “That Heatranvee’s doing a great job. You should be proud.”

Alolan Ninetales blinked.

“Still… maybe I should start a math class.”

Lil Eve grinned wider.

“Only if you finally pass your coding test first.”

A beat of silence. Then...

“Oh please not that again...” Alolan Ninetales groaned, tail drooping as Vaporeon burst into gentle laughter.

Even Flareon cracked a smile as the room shifted from legacy to levity, glowing softly under the starlight of a future still being written.

-

[Scene: Planet Evoir – Chronoscene Reflector Room, Later That Day]

The crystal orb shimmered again, catching everyone's attention as it switched feeds. The peaceful Pokeplanet visuals faded, replaced by an explosion of garish colors and dissonant jingle tunes.

The new feed was live: a drone transmission from NFT777-Enefftia, the infamous casino-planet.

The camera, mounted on a floating scout drone, zipped through the chaotic neon skyline of the gacha-glutted empire. Gaudy banners waved across skyscrapers in pixelated flames and rainbows. Giant screens flashed grotesquely overhyped slogans:

“Draw NOW for a chance at the ultra-rare LEGENDARY HUMAN WAIFU!!”
“SQUARE ROOT SPECIAL EVENT: √((((((((2)))))))) PERCENT CHANCE!”
“NEW NINETALES-THEMED FIGURINE SET, 0.0000003% DROP RATE!!”

Controlling the drone feed remotely were two of the most dangerous minds from the past war: Serenede, the coldly efficient human war strategist, and Enefftian Ninetales, her playful yet cunning vulpine accomplice, herself descended from Alolan Ninetales, yet corrupted by the Enefftian culture of profit and temptation.

They laughed over comms as the banners flickered by, each more absurd than the last.

Inside the Chronoscene Reflector Room, Alolan Ninetales instinctively squinted.

“Oh no...” she muttered. “Not that format again... Who even writes drop rates like that?”

Lil Eve leaned closer, eyes mischievous.

“Come on, do it. Code it. I dare you.”

Alolan Ninetales narrowed her eyes.

“You want me to decode √((((((((2)))))))) just to make a point?”

“Yep.”

“...Fine.”

She pulled out a palm-sized crystal terminal, her tail tapping rhythmically against the floor as she brought up a minimal compiler. Her delicate claws danced across the glowing keys.

Seconds later, she stopped. The result hovered on screen:

≈ 1.41421356% drop rate

Alolan Ninetales stared at it flatly.

“And that's supposed to be exciting?”

Lil Eve smirked.

“Hey, better than 0.0000003%.”

Alolan Ninetales sighed with all the weight of someone who had seen the rise and fall of galaxies.

“How did a descendant of mine end up enabling this?”

Vaporeon peeked over her shoulder and snorted.

“At least they didn’t use imaginary numbers this time.”

Flareon, still being held, tilted his head.

“Give them a week.”

They all groaned in unison.

-

Another spaceship, clearly from the same creators, suddenly dashed in and slammed into the earlier gacha-bannered vessel. 
This time, the drop rate displayed across its hull was even more grotesque:

√√√√√√√√2

In a synthesized voice, the ship politely announced apologies to any nearby alien species for the previous ship’s existence.

The now-crashed gacha ship spiraled out of control and landed squarely on another of Enefftia’s scam vessels, this one a garish MLM ad ship. It had no passengers, only an unnamed automated controller.

Noting the collision, the MLM ship promptly rerouted itself directly into a drifting asteroid. Its guidance system, confused by the solar system’s magnetic field and unable to detect the invisible local sun, registered no reason to stay.

Back in the Chronoscene Room, Alolan Ninetales stared in silence... then facepalmed.

“My descendants are... actual ‘math genius idiots,’” she muttered.

With a sigh, she typed out the unholy √√√√√√√√2 into her interface and calculated the drop rate.

The result popped up on screen.

“It’s even lower. Just by a bit.”

She facepalmed again, ears twitching in mild disbelief.

“I’ve lived for about two billion years to see... this...” she said, dryly. “And somehow, it’s funny.”

-

Alolan Ninetales was still staring blankly at the screen when the door slid open behind her.

She turned, just in time to see Flareon, tightly wrapped in fire-proof and watery ropes, being effortlessly carried in Vaporeon’s arms like a squirming plush toy.

His fluffy tail twitched in protest.
“H-Hey! It’s not like I wanted to be tied up or anything…! I was just trying to, guh, explain logically!” he stammered, looking away with a deep blush.

Vaporeon narrowed her eyes at him. “You were rude to Ninetales.”

Without giving him time to wriggle out of his excuse, she leaned in and kissed him squarely on the cheek, firm, slow, and smug.
“That’s your punishment...” she whispered.

Alolan Ninetales blinked once, then twice. “…You two are unbelievable.”

As if in sync, all three turned their attention back to the glowing math result still lingering on the screen.

√√√√√√√√2 ≈ 1.090507732

There was a long pause.

Flareon, still in Vaporeon’s hold, tilted his head. “That’s… it?”

Vaporeon blinked. “…That’s barely even lower than just √2.”

Alolan Ninetales exhaled a long, dry breath. “Two billion years of wisdom and this is what the galaxy gives me…”

They all silently agreed, this entire mathematical scam thing was stupid. But in a way, tragically hilarious.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Ch 63: KELDEO-E

[Scene: Evoir, Filming Fields – The Next Morning]
The soft golden sky of Evoir cast its morning glow over the grassy plains near the Chronoscene Tower. Vaporeon, still in her frilly maid dress, glided gracefully through the field with a mischievous smile, her arms still wrapped tightly around a tied-up Flareon, who had yet to regain his freedom. His fluffy tail flicked in quiet protest, but he wasn’t truly upset. His cheeks were tinted with a tsundere red.

Flareon (mumbling through the fireproof-and-watery ropes):
"Th-this is a violation of autonomy..."

Vaporeon (teasing):
“Shush, you're still being punished for mocking Ninetales.”

The two paused as a new figure approached, Keldeo, the immortal gakuran-wearing Water/Fighting stallion. His confident stride was matched by the clanging sounds of something mechanical galloping behind him.

Beside him rolled the recently unveiled creation:
KELDEO-E, a shining sword-wielding, junk-collecting, ridable robot horse, glistening with metallic aqua plating and powered by a solar-mana core. Commissioned by Galaxian Magnezone, this machine bore the dignified stance of a knight and the purpose of a restorationist.

In the distance, Evoirian Rapidash, a dazzling Fire/Water mare, stood ready with steam rising gently from her mane, serving as the director in Keldeo’s upcoming film, KELDEO-E: The Rebirth Circuit.

Lil Eve stood nearby, wearing her usual sailor uniform, tapping on her oversized drone controller. Floating beside her was BIGEVE, the eight-elemental flying Eevee-shaped mech, its tails glowing in rotating hues.

Lil Eve (nodding):
“I came up with the KELDEO-E concept after seeing those Neo-Earth human elites chasing galaxies again... and still letting their own planet rot.”

Keldeo (patting the mech's side):
“Let them chase stars. I’ll plant trees under the moonlight.”

BIGEVE whirred approvingly, puffing out tiny gusts of wind and fire, creating a small double rainbow in the air.

Flareon (still tied):
“Where's my robot…”

Vaporeon:
“You are my robot.”

Lil Eve (grinning):
“Let’s film something that matters for once, not gacha, not scams, not square roots of disappointment. Just meaning.”

-

[One Month Later – The Premiere of KELDEO-E: The Rebirth Circuit]

Across projectors in solar gardens and floating screens over serene Evoirian skies, the long-awaited film KELDEO-E rolled out. Attendees across Evoir and sympathetic corners of Erosbloom-89 tuned in, many gathering in community theaters with flowers in hand and recycled snacks on plates.

-

[Act 1 – The Longing]

KELDEO-E, the outdated robot stallion, patrols the ruins of Neo-Earth. With a worn mane of wires and rust-flecked hooves, he plays old records of romantic humans, couples holding hands, dancing under lamplight, sharing meals. He sighs, a mechanical whinny echoing through the hollow cityscape.

KELDEO-E (internal monologue, static-pitched):
"I was built to serve. To ride beside them. To love their life... not mourn their memory."

-

[Act 2 – The Intrusion]

A thunderous descent. A spaceship lands, filled with chrome-plated resource-collector bots, every model visibly superior in design. Among them floats BIGEVE, sleek, deadly, Eevee-shaped with a feminine voice and eight-elemental capability.

BIGEVE scans KELDEO-E. Target lock: "Obsolete."

He panics, hides, trembles in the shadows. His sensors pick up... life. A lone green sapling, struggling in concrete.

Gently potting it, he rolls out. Offers it to her, a token of peace.

BIGEVE stares.

Then, without a word...

She bridal carries him, sapling still safe in his hooves, soaring skyward.

-

[Act 3 – The Betrayal]

Back aboard the mothership, suspicion brews. The elite robots gather.

A drone snarls, “Unauthorized relic detected.”

BIGEVE shields him.

“I’m not like you. I don’t erase. I remember.”

With a burst of rainbow plasma, she unleashes a full elemental barrage ,  fire, water, electric, grass ,  blasting her way through. KELDEO-E is helpless in her arms, clutching the sapling as they bolt toward the last remaining humans.

-

[Act 4 – The Confrontation]

The humans... have grown corpulent. Lazy. Distracted by food tubes and idle luxuries.

BIGEVE sets KELDEO-E down.

He steps forward, trembling.

“Please... one more chance. For life.”

A slovenly man scoffs, but BIGEVE charges her lightning. He flees.

A lone woman steps up.

“...Let’s try again.”

Others join, moved.

-

[Act 5 – The Return]

They land on Neo-Earth. The pot is placed.

BIGEVE summons Grass. KELDEO-E performs a watery Sword Dance, drenching the soil with purified runoff.

A young human approaches and hands him a gleaming, updated sword.

They all watch as the sapling shivers... then blossoms.

-

[Act 6 – The Bloom]

The planet breathes again.

Humans jog. Gardens return. Lakes ripple. Life pulses.

On a hill, KELDEO-E and BIGEVE stand proudly. She bridal carries him under a tree of iridescent leaves, metallic petals fluttering in the breeze.

She kisses him. Their forms gleam beneath twin suns.

The End.

-

[Post-Film Reactions – Evoir, Evening]

In the soft glow of the Chronoscene Room:

Vaporeon still cradles Flareon, who remains tied up even after a full month, slightly more resigned to his fate, but clearly still tsundere.

Flareon (grumbling):
“Tch... overdramatic film... but... not bad.”

Vaporeon (smiling, tail swishing):
“I saw you blush at the kiss scene.”

Flareon:
“D-did not!”

Lil Eve descends nearby, proudly bridal carrying Keldeo, the original immortal stallion himself, now grinning sheepishly like a rebellious boyfriend caught red-hooved.

Lil Eve:
“Think the humans got the message?”

Keldeo:
“If not, we'll make a sequel.”

All four gaze at the final still image on the screen, a sapling silhouetted against a reborn sky, and nod in solemn joy.

-

[Scene: After the Film – Echoes and Growth]

The film ended.
The Reflector screen dimmed, humming softly as it shut itself down.

A moment of stillness followed. Then, with a mechanical flutter, a glossy promotional poster slid out from the Reflector's archive slot and drifted to the floor.

Title:
"KELDEO-E: The Rebirth Circuit"

Printed on it: KELDEO-E, smiling calmly, eyes soft and sincere. Beside him stood BIGEVE, her expression warm, protective, almost maternal. Behind them, stylized circuitry bloomed like vines beneath a peaceful sky. It wasn’t menacing.
It wasn’t cold.
It was… hopeful.

And yet, that image brought everything crashing back.

-

Gardevoir’s breath hitched the moment she saw the word synthetic. Her eyes narrowed.
She remembered the metallic snap of bone, the smell of scorched Hatterene fur.
Her impostor bot had looked just like her. Had acted like her.
Had killed an innocent Hatterene before she could intervene.
She’d torn that machine apart herself, assisted by Miraidon.
Watched her own face shatter into twisted chrome.

-

Alolan Ninetales’ fur bristled beside her.
She remembered waking up inside ice, trapped, paralyzed.
Hearing her impostor using her voice, then the impostor got destroyed by Mimikyu embarassingly.
The way it mocked her without ever saying a word.
She hadn’t screamed. She couldn't.

-

Gardevoir turned away.
Ninetales followed.
Their exit was wordless, abrupt.

Lil Eve blinked. “What just...?”

Keldeo looked from the poster to the empty doorway. “They were... upset?”

“They were impersonated...” Lil Eve murmured. “Back in the Bot War. Saga 3. Without consent.”

“They think this is happening again?”

“No. They remember.”

A heavy silence fell.

Then, a few minutes later, quiet footsteps returned. Gardevoir stood in the doorway again, Alolan Ninetales just behind her.

They didn’t speak at first. Gardevoir simply walked up to the poster and studied it again, really looked at it.

KELDEO-E’s smile was genuine.
BIGEVE’s stance wasn’t imposing. It was protective. Almost gentle.

“…This isn’t them...” Gardevoir finally said.

“No. It’s not...” Alolan Ninetales agreed. Her voice was softer now.

Gardevoir exhaled. “Sorry for storming out.”

Lil Eve smiled faintly. “You earned that right, many times over.”

Keldeo nodded. “You still want to leave?”

Gardevoir shook her head. “No. We’ll stay.”

“We’ve seen monsters wear our faces before...” Alolan Ninetales said. “Doesn’t mean every synthetic does.”

Gardevoir gave a quiet nod toward the poster. “Let’s give them a chance.”

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Ch 64 : 9 Minus 1 Then Square Math Class

[Scene : The Quiet Entry]
Setting: The polished wooden hallway leading into the Evoirian living room.

Vaporeon walked with steady grace, arms wrapped securely around Flareon’s form. The once-fiery butler was still bound in soaked, fireproof ropes, his tail flicking just slightly in protest, more from pride than discomfort.

She stepped into the living room without announcement. The atmosphere was peaceful, the air cooled by slow-turning ceiling fans. Alolan Ninetales sat by the window, cloaked in the soft glow of late afternoon, her light blue sundress fluttering faintly in the breeze.

Flareon stirred, glancing toward her. There was no hostility, no rivalry, just recognition.

-

[Scene : A Quiet Compliment]
Setting: The same room, still, with only the sounds of wind and distant birds.

Flareon’s ears twitched before he finally broke the silence.

"You know... your descendants..." he said, his voice dry but sincere, "They’ve inherited more than just your looks. Clever. Practical. They’re... sharp in all the right ways."

Alolan Ninetales looked toward him slowly. Her gaze was not cold, merely reflective. She said nothing, but her silence gave weight to his words. No deflection. No sarcasm. Just a moment acknowledged.

-

[Scene : Release]
Setting: Center of the living room rug, sunlight spilling across the floor.

Vaporeon gently knelt, still holding Flareon with care. With methodical fingers, she began to untie the soaked bindings, each knot loosened with a soft rustle.

The ropes fell away one by one until Flareon was finally free, the damp remnants coiling loosely on the floor like discarded memories.

She helped him sit upright, her expression calm, yet touched with the quiet satisfaction of resolution.

-

[Scene : Iced Tea and Subtle Thanks]
Setting: Small side table in the living room, with a pitcher and three glasses.

Flareon stood up on his own, rolling his stiff shoulders before making his way to the tray. He carefully poured the tea, taking extra care not to let his inner heat warm the glass.

He carried it to Alolan Ninetales without flair or sarcasm, offering it with the proper form of a servant, though not without meaning. She took it, nodding once in acceptance.

-

[Scene : A Pat, and a Grin]
Setting: By the center of the room, as the sun lowers and shadows begin to stretch.

As Flareon turned to retreat, Vaporeon gently reached out and patted his head.

A pause.

He didn’t brush her off, didn’t scoff. Instead, a slow, sideways grin crept across his face.
"Yeah, yeah... I missed this too..." he muttered, not looking at her but not hiding either.

For the first time in months, his pre-tsundere warmth surfaced, not burning, just gently glowing.

-

[Scene : Chapter 64 Realization]
Setting: Still in the living room, the atmosphere peaceful and light-hearted.

As the calm settled, Alolan Ninetales’s eyes narrowed thoughtfully.

“This… is the 64th chapter...” she said, almost to herself. Then a faint, foxlike smirk curved her lips. “Perfect.”

She rose from her seat and, with a practiced flick of her tail, summoned six old and new devices beside her, each glowing faintly, from retro to modern.

“2-bit. 4-bit. 8-bit. 16-bit. 32-bit. And now...” She turned grandly. “64-bit.”

The room shimmered with quiet blue light as she struck a pose, invoking a subtle melody, Alolan Ninetale’s Perfect Math Class, an ancient remix from the Dragonlet danmaku archive. The tune played softly in the background as she began to code midair with icy glyphs.

-

[Scene : The Math Flex]
Setting: Symbols hover in a projected grid around her like a floating chalkboard.

“Let’s finish with elegance...” she whispered with pride, and with a curl of her tail, typed:

(9 − 1)² =

The result pulsed: 64.

“Perfectly square. Perfectly elegant...” she declared, tail swaying like a metronome.

-

[Scene : Reactions and Revival of Playfulness]
Setting: Still the living room, now filled with playful, nostalgic tech aura.

Flareon blinked at her performance. “That was... ridiculous...” he muttered.

But then, after a pause, he clapped. “Ridiculously impressive.”

Vaporeon nodded with a small, proud smile, then added her own soft clapping, just enough to turn the teasing moment into something warmer.

Flareon turned to her, not resisting the pull of the moment anymore. “Y’know what...”
He leapt into her arms, bridal-style, tail curling with satisfaction. “I missed being carried.”

She caught him effortlessly, chuckling, and kissed his forehead once, 

Then twice...

And again...

Until it reached sixty-four gentle kisses, like ticking numbers in her memory.
He melted into her arms with each one, no longer resisting who he was with her.

-

[Scene : United Applause]
Alolan Ninetales watched the scene unfold with raised eyebrows, then calmly joined in the applause, her tails clapping like fans folding open. The music faded into gentle echoes.

“Chapter sixty-four...” she said with a knowing smirk. “Not bad for a math class.”

-

[Scene : Advanced Math, the Unhinged Way]
Setting: The same living room, bathed in the fading light of late afternoon, soft tech-glow from the bit devices still present.

With the 64-bit finale still floating beside her, Alolan Ninetales flicked her tail again and summoned a new string of icy equations in the air.

“Let’s go deeper...” she murmured, smirking like a professor with too much free time.

She wrote:

((9 − 1)²) + (√9 + ⁶√64)

The symbols pulsed once, 
64 + (3 + 2) = 69

She paused. Glanced at the others.

Then, with no shame, declared softly but confidently:

"Nice."

Her tone was utterly composed, dignified... and completely self-aware.

-

[Scene : Affection Multiplied]
Vaporeon giggled behind her paw, then turned back to Flareon, still content in her arms.

“Well then...” she said, tightening her hold just slightly, “Since it’s still the 64th chapter…”

She leaned down and kissed him again.

Once.

Twice.

Three more times.

Five in total.

A bonus round.

Flareon blinked, still blushing from the earlier barrage, but this time he clapped, while still in her arms, with the enthusiasm of someone surrendering to joy.

“This...” he said with a wide grin, “is unhingedly cute. Who knew math could feel like this?”

-

[Scene : The Echo of Wholesomeness]
Alolan Ninetales closed her floating math panels with a swirl of ice, but her tail still twitched in amusement. “That’s because you were never in my class.” she quipped.

Vaporeon rocked Flareon gently in her arms, her smile calm, proud, and just a bit smug.

And for a moment, even with immortal weight behind their souls, the three of them let the silliness linger, a moment where elegance, play, and affection intersected like perfect geometry.

-

Author’s Note :
Immortality Doesn’t Cancel Karma

Flareon’s month-long restraint, bound in waterlogged, fireproof ropes and carried effortlessly in Vaporeon’s arms, wasn’t just a humorous punishment. It was karma, distilled into immortal form.

His blunt remark about Alolan Ninetales’ descendants back in Chapter 62 may have seemed minor in mortal time, but among the ageless, every word has echo. And Vaporeon, ever the graceful enforcer of balance, delivered that echo with soft strength and sensual discipline.

Yet what matters most is not the punishment, but Flareon’s growth from it.

He came to realize that his recent tsundere edge had grown sharper than it should. Pride had blurred into bluntness. Deflection had masked his sincerity. And while never cruel, he’d lost some of the warmth that once defined him.

So here, in Chapter 64, he finally let go of the pride and gave honest praise, not just to right a wrong, but because he meant it. In doing so, he earned his release, not just from the ropes, but from a fragment of his own emotional restraint.

And in her usual calm strength, Vaporeon welcomed this moment of clarity. She didn’t just untie him. She kissed him. Praised him. Carried him again, this time, by his own choice.

Because even in a world where love endures forever, it still needs to be nurtured, checked, and reshaped. And karma, as always, remembers.

End of Chapter 64

Ch 65: Poketopia 3 Glitched Boss Rush

Scene : Loop of Trials
In the infinite stillness of the Death Loop Tablet, Regigigas endures yet another game, another performance in pursuit of a more merciful death.

Lately, his efforts have not gone unseen. The ground/steel-type streamer, Cosmician Sandslash, has been broadcasting Regigigas’ games to wide acclaim. What was once silent torment is now spectacle, offering him dignity, if not peace.

-

Scene : The Bot Gauntlet Announcement
One day, the tablet shifts.

A new challenge appears:
Fight all 30 illusion-replicated bots from the old Bot War, the terror that once plagued Pokeplanet in Saga 3.

Victory grants a gentle death... delivered by Durabot’s soft Dragon Pulse.

Regigigas pauses.
He remembers them well. He’s seen their war footage, a copy gifted to him by the real, immortal policewoman Gardevoir.
Even Alolan Ninetales, serene in her sundress, had turned away in embarrassment when her bot’s footage played.

-

Scene : Opening Rounds – Cannon Fodder
He begins with the weakest:

Blisseybot slaps him harmlessly. Regigigas flicks her away like a leaf.

Greedentbot follows, no threat.

Pikabot is next. Gigas scoffs: "This one represents fear? Pathetic."

Slowbot, Eldebot, and Venubot offer slightly more resistance, but fall all the same.

-

Scene : Avenge the Fallen
Then comes Cinderbot.

Regigigas narrows his eyes.
He remembers Cinderace, one of Darkrai’s murder victims in Saga 2.
"This one fell to darkness..." he mutters, and with a thunderous blow, he “avenges” the fallen.

-

Scene : Mid-Tier Brawls
Sylveonbot, Wigglybot, Garchompbot, Zardbot (Charizard's bot), Zerabot, Snorlaxbot, each one manageable.

Then:

Crustlebot.
The walls press in. The trolling is real.
But Regigigas recalls the NaclCraft mod. He counters the maze’s logic and strikes the core.

-

Scene : Ice and Grief
Ninetalebot appears, freezing the air.

He remembers falling to this illusion before.
"Not this time." He pierces the bot’s chest.
"Forgive me, real one..."

Mamobot follows. Unknown to him, he mimics Mamoswine, the long-lost husband of Alolan Ninetales. He defeats him without knowing the sorrow he stirs.

-

Scene : Creators and Regrets
Then, twin echoes of redemption:

Mimebot, the reflection of the fallen creator.

Crambot, the partner in crime.

He hesitates... and bows before striking.
"Your real selves saved my world. Rest now."

-

Scene : Steep Climb Begins
Next come the heavy hitters:

Absolbot, Talonbot, Gengarbot, Blastoisebot, all strong, but not unbeatable.

Greninjabot uses Double Team to infuriating effect, but is eventually stomped.

-

Scene : Fighting Spirit
Then, the wildest fight: Machampbot.

He approaches with glowing ゴゴゴ aura, fists flying in a JoJo-style ORA ORA ORA barrage.

"This is Fighting Wind Requiem!" he roars, "You will never reach the truth!"

Regigigas mutters, "King Crimson."
He lands a perfect surprise counter. Machampbot falls.

-

Scene : Personal Echoes
Lucabot down.
He remembers the real Lucario, Gardevoir’s late husband. His eyes soften.

Gardebot is vicious, moonblasting, black-holing.
Regigigas finds a pole, counters her slowness, and slams her into defeat.
"Forgive me, true protector."

-

Scene : Final Trials
Trevbot mocks him. “Bots are the future.”
Regigigas ignites a flame cannon. No future for this one.

Dragobot whispers: “Kill yourself. Let go.”
Regigigas redirects the divebomb strikes and ejects the bot into space.

Espeonbot hits where it hurts, replaying past death scenes, violating his psyche.
"No..." he mutters, "Flareon's real mother would never do this."
He plants surprise bombs and ends her.

-

Scene : The Final Boss
Tyranitarbot.

A fair, one-on-one slugfest, no illusions, just pure strength.

Regigigas remembers killing the real Tyranitar in Saga 4, only for Ho-Oh to resurrect him... and die in return.

"Stone. Floor. Slam."
He breaks the bot with dignity.

-

Scene : Mercy Granted
Then, Durabot appears, calm, warm, and kind.

No malice. No hostility.

Just a gentle, whispering Dragon Pulse to grant Regigigas the least painful death he’s earned all cycle.

-

Scene : Stream Applause
From outside the Death Loop Tablet, Cosmician Sandslash grins.

His chat explodes in applause.
He raises a metal claw: "Let’s give it up for our gentle titan, Regigigas!"

-

Scene : Chat Reactions and Reverence
The stream erupts.

Cosmician Sandslash’s chat floods with praise:

"He bowed to Mimebot... that’s class."
"Did you see how he spared no blow, yet respected the real ones?!"
"The queen would be proud... Gardebot may fall, but Gardevoir stands eternal."

Some viewers even clip the apology to Gardebot and the whisper to Ninetalebot, calling them “the kindest deathblows ever delivered in gaming history.”

-

Scene : The Forwarded Stream
Cosmician Sandslash hesitates for a moment… then decides.

He forwards the full VOD to Gardevoir, knowing she will understand the nuance.
He doesn’t forward it to Alolan Ninetales, not out of malice, but out of tact.
She’s proud, and that bot... wasn't her finest hour.

-

Scene : Reactions at the Immortals' Domain
In the eternal villa atop Evoir's observatory, Gardevoir receives the footage.

She watches quietly, eyes calm, one hand over her heart.

A soft smile forms.

But she isn’t alone.

From the corner, Alolan Ninetales had peeked.
She watches too.

When Ninetalebot appears and freezes... only to be pierced with an apology...
Her ears twitch.
Her cheeks burn.

She dives under a pillow, mortified.

-

Scene : Enter the Fire and the Tide
Moments later, the Fireboy and Watergirl arrive.

Flareon, the immortal butler, senses something’s up.
Vaporeon, ever graceful, leans beside her embarrassed husband.

Then Flareon sees Espeonbot on the playback.

His breath stops.
That was the impostor of his mother.

He clenches a paw softly.

“I still remember... Saga 3...” he murmurs. “When I couldn’t move... when her face wasn’t hers anymore...”

Vaporeon nods gently.

“I remember too. That’s when I lifted you... bridal style. And Saga 4 onwards... It all started from there.”

A warm silence.
Alolan Ninetales hears them from under the pillow.

-

Scene : Deflection and Thermometers
Alolan Ninetales peeks out, ears red.

She blurts, “S-So... how’s that thermometer challenge going, Flareon?”

He blinks. “Wait, what...?”

“Let’s go test it in the lab! Temperature resilience, right?” she insists.

Vaporeon chuckles.
“Water between fire and ice...” she teases. “I’ll be the safety net.”

-

Scene : A Heated Lab Break
In the immortal lab, chaos ensues:

The room’s temperature spikes from Flareon’s side.

Ice crystals and temperature dropped form on Alolan Ninetales’ side.

Vaporeon swirls through the middle, keeping balance.

Their laughter echoes through the crystal walls.

From afar, Gardevoir watches the chaos and smiles again, fond and motherly.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Ch 66: The Boy Who Loved Bugs, 666 Parent Warns

[Scene - Flashback, Neo-Earth, Some Years Ago]
There once lived a boy on Neo-Earth.
He didn't speak much.
He didn't make many friends.
He collected insects.

Not to harm.
Not to dominate.
But to understand.

He built tiny homes for beetles in the roots of trees.
Named every butterfly he met.
Whispered softly to centipedes like they were his classmates.

He called himself Buggleby.
No one else ever used that name. Only he did.

His parents didn't understand.

“Catching bugs? That’s not how you make a living.”
“Stop being weird.”
“You need a real future, in a store, an office, anywhere normal.”

They mocked his notebooks.
Burned his sketches.
Threw out his beetle jars.

But when you're told your love is unacceptable long enough…
Eventually, something breaks.

And so it did.

Buggleby fought back.
Physically. Emotionally. Loudly.

The system labeled him a danger.
Society deemed him a mistake.
His parents… too little, too late.

And so, they exiled him.
To Diamond-666, the cold fortress world of authoritarian humanity.

-

[Scene - Diamond-666, Before the Peace, The Scientist’s Descent]
On Diamond-666, where kindness was a liability and empathy a myth, Buggleby thrived, if one could call it that.

Among broken geniuses and scarred minds, he joined humanity’s grimmest scientific circle.
Together, they developed Poké Balls, containment orbs born from both fascination and obsession.

For Buggleby, it was no longer about sharing life with insects.
It was about owning them.
Controlling them.
Reducing nature to parameters.

He never laughed again.

One day, without ceremony, Buggleby stood before the capsule bay, waved once to the scientist-leader Oaker, and ejected himself into deep space.

He did not scream.
He did not look back.
He had programmed the course himself:

Into the system’s sun.

A glowing farewell to a world that never let him belong.

His parents tried to apologize.
To reverse the exile.
To say the words they never said.

But by then…

It was too late.

-

[Scene - On Evoir, in Present Day]
The tale was recovered and rendered into crystal holovid.
Evoir’s mortal education council marked it “Essential Viewing: Parental Responsibility.”

In the immortal family wing, a rare moment unfolded.

Flareon, in his butler garb, sat still.
Vaporeon, the eternal maid, curled her water-trimmed tail around her family.
And between them, in a neatly pressed seifuku uniform, sat Lil Eve, their daughter, the immortal born of contrast and care.

The video ended.
No music.
No narration.
Only silence.

Flareon's flames dimmed as he blinked at nothing.
Vaporeon looked to her daughter, not to instruct, but simply to exist beside her.

Lil Eve didn’t cry.
She didn’t need to.
She understood the message deeper than most mortals ever could.

The silence wasn’t awkward.

It was sacred.

And then, gently, to disrupt the quiet, Vaporeon whispered:

“Would you have befriended him, Lil Eve?”

A pause.
A nod.

And Flareon added:

“We would’ve let him build bug homes in our garden.”

Lil Eve smiled.
Just a little.

-

[Scene - Evoir, West of Neo-Evoir City - Flames, Water, and the Mind]
After the tale of Buggleby faded from the screen, silence lingered, but it did not last forever.

Flareon, Vaporeon, and Lil Eve stepped outside their domehouse atop the cascading glade of western Neo-Evoir City. The sky shimmered in tones of twilight, an eternal dusk unique to this region.

Down by the spiraling walkway, voices rose in heated waves.

A family quarrel.
One all too familiar.

At the edge of the plaza stood a sharply robed Galaxian Alakazam, a male of stellar origin and sharp discipline. Psychic/Dark by typing, he radiated logic… and impatience.

“You waste your life collecting junk parts, Kadrabra! Why not refine your mind into real science? A career that matters!”

Opposite him, the younger Cosmician Kadabra, Psychic/Steel, forged from satellite steel and comet cognition, defended himself.

“It’s not junk! I can fix things! I can repurpose, rebuild.”

“To what end? You won’t be respected. You won’t be safe.”

Their argument rattled the small crystals lining the sidewalk.

Standing behind them was Cosmician Gothitelle, Ice/Dark, mother, wife, and muted observer. Cloaked in her velvet black coat and icy breath, she looked on in silence, afraid to interject.

But just as Kadabra's aura flared silver-blue, an oncoming Steel Beam, born of frustration, 

Lil Eve moved.

A whip of Flamethrower Trail snapped between them, parting the emotional storm with living fire.

Then came Surfing Waterfall, a spiraling ribbon of water that splashed from the sky down upon Kadabra, soaking him in its calming cascade.

“Enough...” Lil Eve whispered. “You’re not enemies.”

Galaxian Alakazam's eyes glowed, ready to strike in response, until Flareon stepped in, matching his energy. Flames roared at his fingertips, unmoving but unyielding.

“Do not escalate this. You're still his father.”

Meanwhile, Vaporeon approached the frozen Cosmician Gothitelle with a gentle nod.
She handed her a portable holovid crystal.

“Watch this. You may see your own story… if things had gone worse.”

Cosmician Gothitelle trembled, but obeyed. Her fingers clasped the holovid.

Flareon, flames still humming from his paws, forced the father to watch alongside her.
Lil Eve conjured Grass Vines, wrapped them gently around Kadabra, not to restrain, but to still his wandering mind.

Together, under quiet starlight, the arguing family watched the entire footage of Buggleby’s fall.

And when it ended…

No words were spoken for several minutes.

Cosmician Kadabra bowed his head.

“Maybe I don’t want to escape into junk collecting... but to help others fix what they throw away.”

Galaxian Alakazam breathed heavily, then looked to his wife, his son, then down at his own trembling hands.

“Maybe… I was afraid. Afraid he’d suffer like I did. But I never saw he just wanted to be… whole. I can still support that. Gently.”

Cosmician Gothitelle, holding back tears of cold vapor, finally stood straight and stepped forward.

“Then do it. Support him. Encourage him. Guide, don’t command. We do this together.”

The family stood closer now. Still awkward. Still cracked. But no longer breaking.

-

[Scene - Diamond-666, Present Day - The Sunless Lab]
On the gray-blue surface of the battle-worn planet of Diamond-666, inside the Peace Archives Tower, a different figure read from the past.

Professor Junipa, a woman in her late 40s with streaks of white in her hair and wisdom in her voice, she's a lab coated human with pencil skirt and glasses, stood in silence over a dusty capsule labeled:

“Buggleby - Suicide Archive - 97-SS-Class Clearance”

She read the note.
All of it.
Quietly.
Without blinking.

Then she turned toward the comms window, which revealed the sunlight of the local system reflecting off a trade vessel inbound from NFT777-Enefftia.

It had been one year since she signed the Poké Ball Abolition Act.
She had replaced containment with partnership.
Captivity with care.

Her voice echoed softly into the recorder:

“Your pain changed our path, Buggleby.
I wish you could’ve seen what your legacy really became.
Not containment.
But caution.
Not fear.
But reform.”

She set the note back in its vault and locked it once more.

Far above her, the satellite relays beamed the newest laws across the system.

-

[Scene - Neo-Evoir City, Evoir, After the Argument Calmed]

In the heart of Evoir, a young psychic/steel-type Cosmician Kadabra polished his first handmade repair drone, with his mother smiling nearby, and his father watching, silent but proud.

As dusk deepened and quiet returned to the neighborhood, Cosmician Kadabra busied himself behind the family’s workshop alcove, sorting through old scraps and refit tech. Amid tangled wires and rusted plating, his hand brushed against something odd, three small sticks wrapped in aged tape, tagged with fading hazard symbols.

He squinted. “...Dynamite?”

Turning to his father, now seated nearby with a warm cup of cosmic tea, he held them up.

“Hey… is this stuff safe to experiment with?”

Galaxian Alakazam stared at it, his brows lifting in alarm.

“No. Absolutely not. Those are chemically unstable and pre-date our current safeties. Do not touch the fuses.”

There was a time when Cosmician Kadabra would have argued. Would have rolled his eyes. Would have said you’re just overreacting again.

But not today.

“Alright. Got it. I’ll dispose of them the right way.”

He smiled faintly as he packed them safely into an isolation container.

“Guess even imperfect parents still know dangerous stuff when they see it.”

Galaxian Alakazam chuckled, nodding in approval, both at the caution and the wisdom.

Behind them, Cosmician Gothitelle emerged from the porch with a datapad, waving it like a mother proud of her trivia.

“Actually, if you do want to know what kind of junk’s secretly explosive, Cosmician Sandslash has an entire stream series called ‘Boom or Bunk’. He’s reviewed all sorts of weird old tech. I’m a paid subscriber, by the way.”

Cosmician Kadabra blinked.

“Wait, you watch streamers?”

“I don’t just watch, I participate in the monthly Q&A.”
She winked. “You should too. If you’re gonna work with salvaged tools, learn from someone who knows which ones can vaporize your eyebrows.”

He laughed, real, unforced laughter, for the first time in days.

“...Yeah. That sounds fair.”

As they returned indoors, the repaired family felt lighter somehow.
Not perfect.
But healing.

And far away, in a corner of Evoir’s digital sky, Cosmician Sandslash’s next episode thumbnail lit up:

"Tonight on Stream: 3 Items You Should NEVER Use Without Goggles - One of Them Is ALIVE."

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Ch 67 : Temperature Bender Silliness

[Scene: VBend Simulation – “Gentry Mansion: Maid & Butler Edition”]

The digital air shimmered as Vaporeon, eternal maid of Evoir, logged into the VBend chamber. The system loaded her in, except this time, not as herself. Not quite.

She stood tall in a crisp butler uniform, tailored to her aquatic curves, giving off a poised, masculine aura. Her arms, broad and well-formed, gleamed under the simulated light as she rolled her sleeves and flexed with quiet confidence.

A moment later, her partner phased in. Flareon, the ever-dutiful immortal butler, now materialized in a lacey, monochrome maid outfit, head slightly tilted, a frilly cap balanced atop his messy orange hair. He blinked, voice shy and soft as chiffon.

“I-I suppose I’ll wear this today,” he said, unusually meek. “Might as well commit, right…?”

Vaporeon chuckled deeply, walking over and sliding a strong arm behind his knees.

Before Flareon could react, she lifted him with ease, one arm beneath his legs, the other supporting his back. A full butler-carry.

“D-dear!” he gasped, cheeks flushed. But then… a giggle. Soft, musical, and wholly feminine.

She grinned with masculine pride. “Told you I’d carry you no matter the universe.”

And like that, they stayed there, kissing in the virtual sunbeams, tangled in that role-reversed tenderness for three peaceful in-game hours.

-

[Scene: The Next Morning – VHumanMon Login Chamber]

The avatars reloaded, new platform, new world.

Vaporeon entered first, materializing as a human woman with a flowing blue ponytail, sleek figure, and athletic poise. She stretched out her arms and picked out a cheerleader outfit, complete with pom-poms and a confident smirk.

Flareon followed, this time as a modestly toned human man with pointy red-orange hair. He browsed the presets with a thoughtful squint before settling on the quarterback uniform, classic reds with padded shoulders.

“It’s been a while since we did these outfits,” he noted.

“I still remember how to lift a quarterback,” Vaporeon teased.

Before he could react, she swooped in again. With perfect human muscle memory, she bridal-carried him across the locker room zone. He let out a brief sound of surprise, then smiled.

“I’m never too heavy for you,” he whispered, relaxed in her arms.

“Never...” she replied, her voice low and steady. “Even in this world, I’ll always carry you.”

They walked on through the stadium-themed starting zone like that, cheerleader carrying quarterback, neither ironic nor comical. Just two immortals weaving love through the shape of every world they entered.

-

[Scene: Poketopia – Neo-Evoir City, Shallow Lakeside]

The sky above Neo-Evoir City glowed in soft amber as the sun began its descent, casting long reflections over the tranquil shallow lake that wound through the central park of Poketopia. The water shimmered like polished glass, disturbed only by ripples from Vaporeon's graceful steps.

In her arms, Flareon rested calmly in butler fashion, arms lightly draped around her shoulders, his tail flicking in playful sync with her gait. She held him bridal-style, just as they often did in their cherished VR games, maid carrying butler, but now in quiet real-world serenity.

The lake was shallow enough to cross, but Vaporeon insisted on carrying him.

“You walked all day,” she had said. “Let me take you the rest.”

But halfway through, a sudden blast of cold struck the lake’s surface. A shimmering mist, followed by a sudden crackle of ice magic. The water around Vaporeon's legs abruptly froze, up to her thighs. The motion halted. The prank had backfired.

“Ninetales…” Flareon mumbled under his breath, sensing who was responsible.

From the treeline, a faint giggle vanished behind a snowy tuft.

Still cradled in her arms, Flareon’s inner heat aura began to radiate gently. The warmth pulsed in waves, not furious or flaming, but steady like a hearth in winter. The ice began to melt, drop by drop, his ambient warmth freeing her limbs without her needing to struggle.

She smiled as she looked down at him. “I guess I’m the one being carried now.”

He looked up at her, smile soft and unguarded. “I’ll always melt you out. You carry the weight, I carry the fire.”

The ice fully dissolved. The rippling water returned, flowing beneath them, the surface echoing with soft waves, like a torch carried on tide, love enduring even in elemental mischief.

And so she continued walking, her arms around her eternal partner, the tide carrying her flame, the flame keeping her free.

-

[Scene: Evoir – Temperature Calibration Lab, Neo-Evoir City]

The sleek, glass-walled temperature lab shimmered under the glow of crystal-lit panels, a high-tech facility rarely used for competitions, until now.

Vaporeon stood in the center, clipboard in paw, tail swishing as she wore a mock-serious expression. A digital thermometer floated beside her, calibrated precisely to 0.000001 accuracy. She glanced at the two buckets in front of her, one gently boiling, the other crusted in hoarfrost.

Across from each other stood the elemental duelists:
Flareon, exuding intense radiance with the playful grin of a boy ready to show off.
Alolan Ninetales, dignified yet determined, the tips of her snowy fur glowing faint blue.

“I apologize again for the lake stunt.” Ninetales said, bowing her head lightly. “I didn’t expect it to freeze that suddenly.”

“No hard feelings.” Flareon smirked, “But now we settle it... the 69°C challenge.”

“Accepted!” she replied coolly, her breath visibly frosting the air.

-

[Moment Later – Calibration Round Begins]

Flareon stepped forward first, conjuring a precise burst of flame into the water bucket. It bubbled steadily as he held his paw over it like a chef monitoring soup. After a few seconds, he stepped back with confidence.

Alolan Ninetales approached hers, encasing it with a swirling blizzard spiral. The ice crept inward like petals folding in reverse, until the center crystallized to absolute stillness.

Vaporeon carefully dipped the thermometer into Flareon’s bucket. The display blinked for a moment, then read out:

69.696999°C

Flareon puffed his chest proudly.

Then she turned to Ninetales’ frozen bucket. The probe pierced the surface like glass cracking under light pressure. A moment later:

–69.666999°C

A brief pause.

All three of them said it in chorus:

“…Nice.”

They all burst into soft, controlled laughter, Vaporeon covering her face with a paw, Flareon bending slightly with a snort, and even Alolan Ninetales letting out a rare, melodic giggle.

“You win by decimals.” Flareon nodded toward her.

“No...” Ninetales smirked, “we’re both professionals in extreme conditions.”

“Still,” Vaporeon said, clearing her throat and regaining her judge voice, “the real winner is the science of friendship… and math jokes.”

“Boo.” Flareon grinned.

-

[Scene: Death Loop Tablet – Thermal Gauntlet Level]
The air sizzled, crackled, and froze in mad alternation. In a nightmarish simulation of fire, ice, and drowning hazard roulette, Regigigas lumbered forward with heavy, slow-paced leaps. Below him, Sharpedos swarmed in frigid waters, snapping their teeth at anything that dared touch the surface. Above him, flamethrower turrets swung back and forth like wicked pendulums, while ice spikes jutted out from unpredictable directions.

The platforms beneath him were either slick with frost or steaming with heat, often both within seconds. Fire pillars hissed upward. Ice fragments shattered underfoot. The temperature gauge above the screen flickered like a dying signal.

Regigigas cursed under his breath as another fireball nicked his arm.

"Temperature error: 999°C to -999°C detected."
"Pain level adjusted."

“Of course it is,” he muttered, ducking just in time before an ice spike grazed his back.

-

[Scene: Streaming Room – VBend Hub, Neo-Evoir Orbit]
Cosmician Sandslash, wearing his full streamer headset and plush gaming chair, watched intently, one paw dipping into hot soup, the other scooping ice cream. The thermal contrast didn't bother him, it was on theme. His overlay chat buzzed as viewers laughed, sent tips, and threw emojis of fire and snowflakes.

Chat: “He’s dodging like a toaster in a blizzard LMAO”
Chat: “Can Sharpedo bite through legendary plates?”
Chat: “WHAT’S THIS TEMPERATURE RNG???”

“LET’S GOOOOOO, GIGAS!” Sandslash shouted with a grin. “This is your redemption arc! Don’t let the Sharpedos get your ankles again!”

As he prepared his next comment overlay, VBend suddenly activated, syncing his avatar live on-stream. Sandslash blinked, and in an instant... 

He appeared on the virtual side screen as a girl in a cropped “Gamer Girl” T-shirt and sparkly skirt, complete with bold eyeliner and sassy pose. The transformation was seamless.

He tilted his head, looked at the screen, then deadpanned into the mic:

“…Yep. VBend got me again. Genderbent mid-soup.”
He flexed with mock pride. “Still handsome. Let’s stream it anyway.”

Chat exploded.

Chat: “Gamer Girl Sandslash arc LET’S GO”
Chat: “You slay. Literally.”
Chat: “She’s beauty, she’s grace, she’s the soup queen of space”

Back inside the game, Regigigas saw the “Gamer Girl Sandslash” avatar cheering him from a floating screen above, giving thumbs-ups between bites.

“YOU CAN DO IT,” Sandslash’s squeaky genderbent voice echoed.
“Just don’t fall in the soup.”

Regigigas sighed heavily, dodged a flaming platform, then got hit by a freeze beam.

“…I miss being in a forest.”

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Ch 68 : Extraterrestrial Food Run

[Scene: Interplanetary Route – En Route to Div-9K]
Cosmician Sandslash leaned back in his loop-powered space cruiser, a grin stretched across his snout. The spacecraft, shaped like a giant metallic Sonic loop-de-loop, spun violently in a blur of rings and centrifugal energy. The Sonic Space Loop engine roared louder the faster it looped, converting childlike nostalgia into quantum propulsion.

“Alrighty, seven-day chill trip to Div-9K.” Sandslash muttered into his mic, licking a scoop of mochi-styled ice cream. “Just me, my chat, interstellar snacks... and my eternally cursed guest.”

He turned to the side, a secure containment glass tablet pulsed in the co-pilot’s seat, held upright by stabilizing rings and layered protective charms. Inside it: Regigigas, still in his Death Loop Tablet, currently mid-game and very not chill.

-

[Scene Within the Death Loop Tablet – Regi Rush Zone]
Regigigas, with his colossal frame cartoonishly squashed into the shape of a Sonic knockoff, was sprinting through a jagged 2D side-scrolling hellscape. Below: pits of spikes. Above: flamethrower drones. Timer: ticking toward zero.

He crushed a speed boost orb, dodged an anvil, and barely slid under a collapsing wall of magma bricks.

“REGI RUSH: ACT 4 – OGI ONIONLAND”

At the far end of the horizon, his reward and exit bait floated gloriously: giant golden onion rings, pulsing with unhealthy fats and sweet scent illusions.

“GET TO THE ONION RINGS IN TEN MINUTES OR DIE FROM SPACE SUFFOCATION.”
“IF YOU WIN: DEATH BY HEART FAILURE. SOFTER. MORE DIGNIFIED.”
“TIME REMAINING: 01:23”

He grunted in pain as an unexpected spring trap launched him backward into a cryonic wind tunnel. A red warning blinked:

“YOU SLIPPED ON GARLIC GREASE – STAMINA REDUCED.”

“Who built this level?” Regigigas wheezed, struggling to move.

[Scene: Back to Reality – Sonic Loop Cruiser Cockpit]
“...Right, chat, he's getting to the onions...” Sandslash said with a mouthful of popcorn, leaning into the camera in his VBend girl form, now with virtual sunglasses and his “LOOP ME HARDER” t-shirt. “If he makes it, it’s a fatty death, not a vacuum scream one.”

The chat exploded.

Chat: “RUN REGI RUN”
Chat: “SUFFER FOR THE RINGS”
Chat: “LOOPED SO HARD HE BECAME HIS OWN FAN GAME”

The Sonic Space Loop passed another moon, looping again.

-

[Scene: Final 10 Seconds – Inside Regigigas’ Game]
He launched off the final hill. The giant onion ring monument glowed with triumphant grease light. Regigigas panted, he could taste the caramelized burn.

5 seconds.

He dove, face first, into the onion ring portal.

-

[Scene: Space Cruiser]
The tablet flashed “SOFT DEATH UNLOCKED – cardiac arrest simulated in sleep mode.”

Cosmician Sandslash nodded. “Good job, big guy. You earned your onion.”

He leaned back, engines humming gently now as they neared Div-9K, stars bending softly around the curved windows. A warm silence filled the cruiser cabin, punctuated only by Sandslash spooning ice cream into his mouth.

“Next game,” he whispered, “Regigigas becomes a cooking papa…”

-

[Scene: Div-9K – Electro Market District, Noonlight Haze]
The Sonic Space Loop cruiser touched down gently, kicking up electric pollen dust from the vibrant glowing plants that laced the walkways of Div-9K. Neon petals shimmered in midair, and delivery drones buzzed overhead like cicadas on espresso.

From the open market plaza, a loud voice rang out.

“Yo! Long time, Sandslash!”

Enefftian Scovillain, a rare Grass/Electric variant of his species with hypercharged twin heads and a stylish utility vest, was carefully unloading a cart of locally grown electro-chillis, handing over a crate to a tall, buff human with kitchen scars and martial bandages: Pizzero, Fighting-type-typed, the battle-chef of Div-9K.

Pizzero grinned. “These’ll light up the tongues and the scoreboard.”

Cosmician Sandslash, still in his VBend girl avatar, waved and jogged over. “Need a tour guide, and you’re the spice trail boss. I wanna see how Div-9K’s eating these days.”

Scovillain chuckled, his electric tendrils flaring with pride. “You’re a customer again, huh? Alright. Let’s start with the Voltage Alley.”

Sandslash nodded, carrying the Death Loop Tablet under one arm like a clipboard.

-

[Scene: Within the Death Loop Tablet – Regigigas: DoughMaze Horror]
Inside the flickering screen:

Regigigas now lumbered through a nightmare-flavored digital maze, modeled after a parody version of Pac-Man. The grid shimmered with sprinkled donut dots, each one reducing his final pain level if eaten. The background was a dissonant lullaby remix, warped like a broken record.

MISSION: CONSUME ALL DONUTS BEFORE BEING DRAINED.
“DEATH GOAL: TYPE-3 DIABETES WITH SUGAR COMA EUTHANASIA”
ENEMIES: GENGAR ILLUSIONS x4 – CONTACT = DREAM EATER

He turned a corner, just as a giggling Gengar illusion phased in from a wall, shimmering purple with psychic residue.

“DREAM EATER ENGAGED.”

The titan's heavy legs slowed. The maze bent sideways. Sprinkles melted into teeth. His head pounded, nightmare loops, personal regrets, and flashes of Saga 3 flashed before his mind. His body became heavy with syrupy dread.

Outside the tablet, a red warning blinked:
[MENTAL COLLAPSE IMMINENT – DREAM SPIKE 87%]

-

[Scene: Voltage Alley – Div-9K]
“Yo, uh, your guy’s getting munched by dreams agai.” Scovillain warned, noticing the flicker.

Sandslash clicked his tongue. “Eh, he'll walk it off. The donut ones are kinder deaths compared to the lava races.”

He gently tapped the tablet. “C’mon big guy. You can tank one Gengar bite.”

Scovillain led them past neon spice stands, thunderfruit cafes, and an open-air VR salon.

Pizzero caught up, holding a mini-calzone and flipping it like a kunai. “Hey, if your titan buddy wakes up and wants to die eating, I got this twelve-layer electric lasagna. One slice’ll shut down an elephant.”

Sandslash’s eyes lit up behind gamer girl glasses. “Add that to the mercy meal tier.”

-

[Scene: Voltage Alley Pizza Stand – Div-9K, Afternoon Heat Pulse]
The neon buzz of the market was briefly interrupted by a flustered voice.

Pizzero, wiping sweat from his brow with a fireproof towel, leaned closer to Cosmician Sandslash, who was still cheerfully posing in his VBend girl-mode.

“Hey uh… buddy. Mind turning off the avatar filter for now?”
He scratched the back of his neck, eyes awkwardly darting away.
“I’m kinda… women-shy. You know. Can’t focus when you’re rocking the whole… gamer skirt thing.”

Sandslash blinked. Then sighed, half-laughing. “Fair enough.”

With a flick of his console ring, the VBend filter shimmered off, and Cosmician Sandslash returned to his default male form, broad-shouldered, sandy armored plating polished with a casual matte, and a backpack still hung with energy drink clips.

“Better?”

Pizzero relaxed visibly. “Much.”

He placed an order into the terminal. “Four electro-chilli pizzas, two with double plasma sauce.”

Just then, he glanced at the Death Loop Tablet, which was now perched upright on the table.
The glow flickered… and the screen burst into movement.

-

[Scene: Inside Death Loop Tablet – Regigigas: Pizzero Tower]
Cue distorted jazz horns and clanging pans.
Regigigas was sprinting across an absurdly vertical tower of crumbling platforms and chaotic pizza traps, in a side-scrolling fever dream called:

“Pizzero Tower: Regigigas Remix”
“Your Goal: Get Too Fat To Live. Outrun the Pizza-Tyrant Before He Grates You.”

He ground-pounded through cheese golems, dodge-rolled past pineapple traps, and wall-jumped off parmesan cliffs.

The boss chaser, a terrifying Tyranitar illusion shaped like an overbaked slice, roared behind him, crust ablaze.

Regigigas surged forward, final room, a mountain of pizzas awaited.

He devoured them all, even the anchovy-loaded horror.
Screen flashed:

“P-RANK ACHIEVED – BITTERSWEET DEATH INCOMING.”

His sprite inflated to absurd proportions. The screen gently faded to a soft piano note and a title card:

“Cause of Death: Delicious Overload – Well Done.”

-

[Scene: Voltage Alley Table – Div-9K]
The performance ended. The screen dimmed.

Cosmician Sandslash tapped the record stop button.

Pizzero raised his eyebrows, genuinely impressed. “That was... incredible.”

Enefftian Scovillain whistled, arms crossed. “He P-ranked that? That game made a 900 IQ Xurkitree cry on stream.”

Sandslash stretched his arms, smiling. “Titan still got it. Death with flavor.”

Then came a faint buzz from the tablet, a text prompt:

REGIGIGAS REQUEST: ORDER CELEBRATORY PIZZA – SHAPE: ME
TOPPINGS: THICK CRUST. LOTS OF ONIONS.

Sandslash laughed aloud. “He wants a Regigigas-shaped pizza.”

Pizzero cracked his knuckles. “Then I better make it. You don’t ignore a death loop champion’s last meal, even if he’s got a hundred more coming.”

Scovillain high-fived Sandslash, eyes gleaming. “This is why Div-9K’s the best vacation spot. Even deaths are gourmet here.”

-

[Scene: Voltage Alley – Div-9K Open Market, Sunset Orange Haze]
The scent of sizzling electro-chillis filled the alleyway as another customer duo strolled into view:
Divian Empoleon, a tall, regal Water/Poison Pokémon with sleek navy-blue armor plating, walked confidently beside his longtime neighbor, the graceful Divian Milotic, her long, vine-wrapped fins flowing like silk and eyes gleaming like dew-touched leaves.

The two stopped abruptly at the sight of the Regigigas-shaped pizza being boxed up.

Empoleon (raising an eyebrow):
“Is that… meant to be who I think it is?”

Sandslash (nodding proudly):
“Yep. P-ranked his own doom in Pizzero Tower. Had to reward that, obviously.”

Before Empoleon could reply, Scovillain sparked a bolt from his fingertips to re-energize the soil plot beside the oven, a crackle of greenish-blue electricity struck the local pepper crop.

Divian Milotic gasped, jumped with a flutter... 
...and instinctively leapt into Empoleon’s arms.

Empoleon (steady, amused):
“Still the same reflexes, huh?”

She blinked, embarrassed, as Empoleon gently lowered her.

Meanwhile, behind the counter, Pizzero had vanished, ducking behind his prep station again, cheeks flushed red.

Milotic noticed.

Her eyes widened, a little mischievous sparkle in them, then, without missing a beat, she dove behind a tall pizza crate, whispering:

Milotic:
“If he’s gonna hide, I’m hiding too. Rules of mutual shyness.”

There was a short, stunned silence…
Then Sandslash, Empoleon, and Scovillain all burst out laughing.

From behind the crate, Milotic called playfully, “You can come out now, Pizzero. I promise I won’t sparkle too hard.”

Gingerly, Pizzero peeked over the counter, then seeing Milotic still half-hiding, he managed a bashful smile and finally stood up straight.

Pizzero:
“Empoleon, good to see you again. One Regigigas Special?”

Empoleon:
“Yes, and pass my congrats to Sandslash. That death looked glorious.”

Cosmician Sandslash (grinning):
“Most painful heart failure ever streamed. I’m putting it on my channel’s banner.”

Empoleon chuckled, placing the order. Milotic slowly stood too, brushing some imaginary dust off her leafy fins, pretending the last two minutes hadn’t happened.

-

[Scene: Voltage Alley – Div-9K, same location, still sunset-tinted]
The wind whooshed loud.

Suddenly... 
A thudding metal clatter echoed through the square.

A runaway robot, sparking and wobbling, sped past the group. Behind it, a young woman, clearly human, athletic build, dressed in molten-orange overalls and flaming skirt, her flame-scorched ponytail whipping behind her, chased after it.

Human Woman (Fire/Ground, panting):
“Stop! Stop, you half-baked weldpot!”

BOOM!

The robot detonated into a small fireball. A metallic leg flew into a fruit stand. The woman, thrown by the shockwave, flailed mid-air, 

Pizzero blinked once, dashed like a fighting flash...
...and caught her bridal-style inches before she hit the bubbling shallow canal beside the alley.

The others paused in awe.

Sandslash (impressed):
“Yo.”

Empoleon (soft chuckle):
“He’s still got reflexes.”

Scovillain (grinning):
“Smooth!”

Milotic peeked out from her hiding spot behind the crate, eyes wide.

Pizzero landed lightly on his feet, placed the stunned woman gently on the nearby bench.

Pizzero (quickly, flustered):
“You okay? You smell like scorched curry but you’re light as dough.”

Fire/Ground Woman (blushing):
“Y-yeah… I think I broke three ribs and my dignity.”

Before she could say more, Pizzero sprinted away again, diving behind the large crate... 

...but instead of hiding beside Milotic, he accidentally dove right into her, knocking them both into the narrow space between boxes and rolling directly into the entrance hatch of his Chillicano pizza ship’s side compartment.

Metal doors shut.

Milotic (inside, faintly):
“…I’m not sparkling too hard, I swear.”

Outside:

Sandslash and Scovillain burst into full-on laughter, leaning on each other.
Empoleon tried to keep a straight face, but his muffled snorts betrayed him.

Regigigas, watching all this in his Death Loop Tablet (now playing a Dating Sim game where failure leads to being ghosted into oblivion), laughed out loud for the first time in weeks.

Regigigas (text bubble):
“BEST DEATH BY EMBARRASSMENT: UNLOCKED.”
