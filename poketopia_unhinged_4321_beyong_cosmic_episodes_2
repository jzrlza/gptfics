Ch 61: Utopia Planets by Gentle Small Dreams

[Scene: Planet Evoir – Chronoscene Reflector Room]

Alolan Ninetales stood quietly before the shimmering Chronoscene Reflector, the folds of her pale blue sundress motionless in the still chamber. Her timeless expression bore the patience only a Hourai-blessed immortal could possess.

Projected before her was a real-time view of Neo-Earth, a restless human world, buzzing with ambition and desperation.

Countless mortals, their lifespans brief, continued to point their eyes and rockets toward unreachable galaxies. Futile dreams.

“They'll never make it in their lifetime...” Alolan Ninetales muttered dryly, flicking her tails with faint disdain. “Unless they find a way to live forever, which they won't. Mortals always waste what little time they have chasing distant specks... instead of saving the ground beneath their feet.”

The Reflector showed fleets of privately owned spacecrafts lifting off, funded by the elite. These ships rarely returned. Some crash-landed. Others arrived at inhospitable worlds, only to be greeted by cleverly disguised Enefftian Pokémon scammers, who lured desperate travelers into ludicrous schemes.

Alolan Ninetales rolled her eyes.

“Still falling for that ‘free utopia planet’ ad? Honestly.”

[Scene Shift: Pokeplanet – Orbit Archive View]

With a whisper of wind from her tails, she tuned the Reflector to a familiar star. The Pokeplanet.

At least here, she mused, many still lived in harmony with their environment. But even this world wasn’t free of hubris.

The display now showed a sleek chrome spaceship landing awkwardly on a barren, dust-gray planet.

Inside: two Steel/Electric-type Pikachu astronauts, descendants of Kantonian Raichu and Alolan Raichu, emerged from their pod with confidence, suits shimmering with tech and pride.

They posed dramatically at the hatch. One tapped a button, and the door slid open.

They stepped out without atmosphere readings. Without caution. Without air.

Moments later, they dropped.

“Brilliant,” Alolan Ninetales said, not even blinking. “Spent a year flying across the void just to suffocate on arrival. No instincts. No humility.”

She turned away from the Reflector, her sundress fluttering as her tails curled thoughtfully behind her.

“They’re always trying to escape. But sometimes, the real escape… is accepting where you are.”

She left the chamber, silence lingering in her wake.

[Scene: Planet Evoir – Chronoscene Reflector Room, Day 2]

The polished chamber lit softly as the crystalline reflector stirred to life once more. Alolan Ninetales stepped inside with her usual grace, her pale blue sundress whispering with her motion. This time, she wasn’t alone.

Trailing behind her were two familiar figures, Vaporeon, the ever-composed immortal in her frilled maid dress, and Flareon, her loyal husband in sharp butler uniform. They entered with quiet curiosity, their synchronized footsteps the mark of long companionship.

“I want to show you what I saw yesterday,” Alolan Ninetales murmured, gesturing a gloved paw toward the Reflector as it shimmered again.

She brought up the footage of Neo-Earth’s latest batch of would-be star-chasers, rockets taking off into cold oblivion, elite mortals seeking meaning in distant galaxies. Once again, the three watched as another spacecraft landed on a barren rock, its occupants suffocating moments after stepping into a vacuum they never prepared for.

Vaporeon lowered her ears, sighing.

Flareon shook his head.

“Such waste,” he muttered. “If only they cared for their homes like they care for running from them.”

Alolan Ninetales nodded.

“Which is why I’d like you to see something else.”

With a flick of her tails, the reflector’s projection spun, stars blurring into pink and gold, until it steadied on Erosbloom-89, the planet of love and gentler awakenings.

The image focused on two human figures.

Aqualice, a woman with calm, intelligent eyes behind sleek glasses, her long blue hair swaying with every step. A functional maid dress equipped with subtle water-jet wings carried her with ease. In her arms, always, was her beloved: Burnabon.

He wore a neat butler uniform, his short red hair tousled from motion. His flame-channeling gloves glowed faintly as he cooked, cleaned, and tended with quiet diligence, all while resting in his girlfriend’s bridal carry as though it were the most natural state of being.

For a full year now, they had lived this way, joyfully. Immortal not because they sought escape, but because they responded, unknowingly, to a subconscious cry during their time of despair… a cry answered by Bloominian Meloetta herself.

“No dreams of galaxies,” Alolan Ninetales said softly. “Just love, sustainability, and small things that matter.”

Vaporeon blinked thoughtfully, her fin-like tail swaying.

“They water the plants…”

Flareon added with a small smile,

“...and cook for everyone else, too.”

On the Reflector, Aqualice and Burnabon were now helping a group of local villagers harvest rare fruits near a sun-drenched grove. Burnabon, still carried, threw chopped vegetables into a pot with practiced flicks of his flame-gloves. Aqualice laughed and adjusted her grip, careful not to drop him (cannot drop him anyway), while stirring the pot with her barely free hand.

Vaporeon and Flareon shared a knowing look.

In many ways… it felt like looking into a mirror.

“They really still reminding me of us...” Vaporeon said softly, brushing her fin-hand over Flareon's shoulder.

“But human...” Flareon replied, just as gently, leaning into her touch. “And just as devoted.”

The three immortals watched a little longer. No flying ships. No suffocating. Just food, care, laughter, and love that didn’t need to be shouted into the void of space to matter.

Alolan Ninetales gave a rare, genuine smile.

“And that is how you reach the unreachable.”

[Scene: Erosbloom-89 – Eastern Hemisphere, Solarvee’s Garden]

The sky shone with soft gold, brushing its warmth over the rolling, fertile slopes of the eastern region. Sun-kissed breeze danced across the layered gardens built into the rocky terrain, each terrace blooming with edible flowers and hardy vegetables, well-cared for by none other than Solarvee, the Rock/Psychic explorer girl.

Dressed in her signature sun visor and practical boots, Solarvee hummed softly as she levitated a cluster of nutrient-rich stones into the soil, enhancing the roots of her crimson-rooted radishes. She glanced up at the sight of familiar shadows approaching.

Aqualice drifted into view, ever serene, her water-jet wings gliding low above the earth. In her arms, as always, is Burnabon, resting with one arm slung over her shoulder, his fire gloves tucked behind his back like a sleeping ember. Together, they landed beside Solarvee, the gentle spray of water wings watering some nearby bushes mid-landing.

“Mind if we help with lunch?” Aqualice offered with a warm smile.

Solarvee grinned and waved them in with a rock-levitated basket of sweetroots.

“You two know the drill. Burnabon, you’re in charge of grilling again.”

Burnabon smirked from within his eternal cradle.

“As long as Aqualice doesn’t try to roast the veggies mid-carry again…”

A gentle nudge from her water jet made him hush with a smile.

Not far off, a third presence watched them with half-hearted interest. Enefftian Arcanine, Electric/Psychic type, and former resident scammer of NFT777-Enefftia, stood by a shallow rock pool with a fishing rod balanced on his shoulder. His fur was windswept, and his manners cleaner now. He’d been stuck here on Erosbloom-89 for over a year… and something had changed.

Gone were the horniness and sales pitches. Now he wandered the coasts as a simple fisherman, trading fresh catches for vegetables and conversation.

Spotting Solarvee, he approached with a grin.

“You know, you’re glowing today. Did the rocks compliment you, or is it just me?”

Solarvee didn’t even blink. With one psychic tug, she floated a few coins toward him and took the basket of glimmering fish.

“Here. Payment in full. Now go.”

Arcanine blinked.

“...Right. See ya.”

He turned and left, tail flicking once, voice muttering a good-natured “You’re no fun” as he vanished into the rocky path back to the coast.

Just as the fish were being placed into preparation trays by levitating stones, another pair of immortals floated down gently beside the garden wall.

Seifuku Woman and her beloved, Gakuran Man, an ancient couple of unfathomable age, their love having lasted 2.5 billion years, waved warmly. As always, she carried him in bridal fashion, and he rested comfortably as if it were second nature. Which, by now, it was.

“Still gardening, Solarvee?” Seifuku Woman called out.

“Still carrying him?” Solarvee quipped back with a grin.

The group laughed as they set up the long lunch table under the flowering sunbramble tree. Friends reunited, comfort as eternal as the sunlight on this planet.

[Scene Shift: Planet Evoir – Chronoscene Reflector Room]

The ethereal crystals of the chamber glowed faintly as the latest scene played: gardens, laughter, couples held in arms, eternal peace.

Vaporeon, still in her maid dress, leaned gently forward with a sparkle in her eye, and, without warning, scooped Flareon into her arms again.

“I’m not letting you go the rest of the day,” she teased, adjusting her hold just enough to make it snug.

Flareon, dressed in his butler uniform, sputtered.

“H-Hey! This isn’t part of the, !” He folded his arms and turned his head, blushing.
“...Whatever. Not like I hate it or anything.”

Vaporeon smirked.

“Tsundere confirmed.”

The chamber doors opened with a soft tone, and Gardevoir, still aglow with authority and wisdom, stepped in, her psychic presence mingling with the warmth of the room. She looked around at the joyful mischief of her fellow immortals and at the peaceful replay of Erosbloom-89's surface projected above.

She crossed her arms, satisfied.

“This is what I fought for...” she said calmly. “A solar system where dreams stopped being toxic and started becoming gentle.”

The others nodded, knowing full well: it wasn’t just peace they’d built.

It was a future that no one needed to escape from.
