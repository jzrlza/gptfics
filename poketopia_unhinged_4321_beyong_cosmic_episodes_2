Ch 61: Utopia Planets by Gentle Small Dreams

[Scene: Planet Evoir – Chronoscene Reflector Room]

Alolan Ninetales stood quietly before the shimmering Chronoscene Reflector, the folds of her pale blue sundress motionless in the still chamber. Her timeless expression bore the patience only a Hourai-blessed immortal could possess.

Projected before her was a real-time view of Neo-Earth, a restless human world, buzzing with ambition and desperation.

Countless mortals, their lifespans brief, continued to point their eyes and rockets toward unreachable galaxies. Futile dreams.

“They'll never make it in their lifetime...” Alolan Ninetales muttered dryly, flicking her tails with faint disdain. 
“Unless they find a way to live forever, which they likely won't. Mortals always waste what little time they have chasing distant specks... instead of saving the ground beneath their feet.”

The Reflector showed fleets of privately owned spacecrafts lifting off, funded by the elite. These ships rarely returned. Some crash-landed. Others arrived at inhospitable worlds, only to be greeted by cleverly disguised Enefftian Pokémon scammers, who lured desperate travelers into ludicrous schemes.

Alolan Ninetales rolled her eyes.

“Still falling for that ‘free utopia planet’ ad? Honestly.”

-

[Scene Shift: Pokeplanet – Orbit Archive View]

With a whisper of wind from her tails, she tuned the Reflector to a familiar star. The Pokeplanet.

At least here, she mused, many still lived in harmony with their environment. But even this world wasn’t free of hubris.

The display now showed a sleek chrome spaceship landing awkwardly on a barren, dust-gray planet.

Inside: two Steel/Electric-type Pikachu astronauts, descendants of Kantonian Raichu and Alolan Raichu, emerged from their pod with confidence, suits shimmering with tech and pride.

They posed dramatically at the hatch. One tapped a button, and the door slid open.

They stepped out without atmosphere readings. Without caution. Without air.

Moments later, they dropped.

“Brilliant...” Alolan Ninetales said, not even blinking. “Spent a year flying across the void just to suffocate on arrival. No instincts. No humility.”

She turned away from the Reflector, her sundress fluttering as her tails curled thoughtfully behind her.

“They’re always trying to escape. But sometimes, the real escape… is accepting where you are.”

She left the chamber, silence lingering in her wake.

-

[Scene: Planet Evoir – Chronoscene Reflector Room, Day 2]

The polished chamber lit softly as the crystalline reflector stirred to life once more. Alolan Ninetales stepped inside with her usual grace, her pale blue sundress whispering with her motion. This time, she wasn’t alone.

Trailing behind her were two familiar figures, Vaporeon, the ever-composed immortal in her frilled maid dress, and Flareon, her loyal husband in sharp butler uniform. They entered with quiet curiosity, their synchronized footsteps the mark of long companionship.

“I want to show you what I saw yesterday,” Alolan Ninetales murmured, gesturing a gloved paw toward the Reflector as it shimmered again.

She brought up the footage of Neo-Earth’s latest batch of would-be star-chasers, rockets taking off into cold oblivion, elite mortals seeking meaning in distant galaxies. Once again, the three watched as another spacecraft landed on a barren rock, its occupants suffocating moments after stepping into a vacuum they never prepared for.

Vaporeon lowered her ears, sighing.

Flareon shook his head.

“Such waste...” he muttered. “If only they cared for their homes like they care for running from them.”

Alolan Ninetales nodded.

“Which is why I’d like you to see something else.”

With a flick of her tails, the reflector’s projection spun, stars blurring into pink and gold, until it steadied on Erosbloom-89, the planet of love and gentler awakenings.

The image focused on two human figures.

Aqualice, a woman with calm, intelligent eyes behind sleek glasses, her long blue hair swaying with every step. A functional maid dress equipped with subtle water-jet wings carried her with ease. In her arms, always, was her beloved: Burnabon.

He wore a neat butler uniform, his short red hair tousled from motion. His flame-channeling gloves glowed faintly as he cooked, cleaned, and tended with quiet diligence, all while resting in his girlfriend’s bridal carry as though it were the most natural state of being.

For a full year now, they had lived this way, joyfully. Immortal not because they sought escape, but because they responded, unknowingly, to a subconscious cry during their time of despair… a cry answered by Bloominian Meloetta herself.

“No dreams of galaxies...” Alolan Ninetales said softly. “Just love, sustainability, and small things that matter.”

Vaporeon blinked thoughtfully, her fin-like tail swaying.

“They water the plants…”

Flareon added with a small smile,

“...and cook for everyone else, too.”

On the Reflector, Aqualice and Burnabon were now helping a group of local villagers harvest rare fruits near a sun-drenched grove. Burnabon, still carried, threw chopped vegetables into a pot with practiced flicks of his flame-gloves. Aqualice laughed and adjusted her grip, careful not to drop him (cannot drop him anyway), while stirring the pot with her barely free hand.

Vaporeon and Flareon shared a knowing look.

In many ways… it felt like looking into a mirror.

“They really still reminding me of us...” Vaporeon said softly, brushing her fin-hand over Flareon's shoulder.

“But human...” Flareon replied, just as gently, leaning into her touch. “And just as devoted.”

The three immortals watched a little longer. No flying ships. No suffocating. Just food, care, laughter, and love that didn’t need to be shouted into the void of space to matter.

Alolan Ninetales gave a rare, genuine smile.

“And that is how you reach the unreachable.”

-

[Scene: Erosbloom-89 – Eastern Hemisphere, Solarvee’s Garden]

The sky shone with soft gold, brushing its warmth over the rolling, fertile slopes of the eastern region. Sun-kissed breeze danced across the layered gardens built into the rocky terrain, each terrace blooming with edible flowers and hardy vegetables, well-cared for by none other than Solarvee, the Rock/Psychic explorer girl.

Dressed in her signature sun visor and practical boots, Solarvee hummed softly as she levitated a cluster of nutrient-rich stones into the soil, enhancing the roots of her crimson-rooted radishes. She glanced up at the sight of familiar shadows approaching.

Aqualice drifted into view, ever serene, her water-jet wings gliding low above the earth. In her arms, as always, is Burnabon, resting with one arm slung over her shoulder, his fire gloves tucked behind his back like a sleeping ember. Together, they landed beside Solarvee, the gentle spray of water wings watering some nearby bushes mid-landing.

“Mind if we help with lunch?” Aqualice offered with a warm smile.

Solarvee grinned and waved them in with a rock-levitated basket of sweetroots.

“You two know the drill. Burnabon, you’re in charge of grilling again.”

Burnabon smirked from within his eternal cradle.

“As long as Aqualice doesn’t try to roast the veggies mid-carry again…”

A gentle nudge from her water jet made him hush with a smile.

Not far off, a third presence watched them with half-hearted interest. Enefftian Arcanine, Electric/Psychic type, and former resident scammer of NFT777-Enefftia, stood by a shallow rock pool with a fishing rod balanced on his shoulder. His fur was windswept, and his manners cleaner now. He’d been stuck here on Erosbloom-89 for over a year… and something had changed.

Gone were the horniness and sales pitches. Now he wandered the coasts as a simple fisherman, trading fresh catches for vegetables and conversation.

Spotting Solarvee, he approached with a grin.

“You know, you’re glowing today. Did the rocks compliment you, or is it just me?”

Solarvee didn’t even blink. With one psychic tug, she floated a few coins toward him and took the basket of glimmering fish.

“Here. Payment in full. Now go.”

Arcanine blinked.

“...Right. See ya.”

He turned and left, tail flicking once, voice muttering a good-natured “You’re no fun” as he vanished into the rocky path back to the coast.

Just as the fish were being placed into preparation trays by levitating stones, another pair of immortals floated down gently beside the garden wall.

Seifuku Woman and her beloved, Gakuran Man, an ancient couple of unfathomable age, their love having lasted 2.5 billion years, waved warmly. As always, she carried him in bridal fashion, and he rested comfortably as if it were second nature. Which, by now, it was.

“Still gardening, Solarvee?” Seifuku Woman called out.

“Still carrying him?” Solarvee quipped back with a grin.

The group laughed as they set up the long lunch table under the flowering sunbramble tree. Friends reunited, comfort as eternal as the sunlight on this planet.

-

[Scene Shift: Planet Evoir – Chronoscene Reflector Room]

The ethereal crystals of the chamber glowed faintly as the latest scene played: gardens, laughter, couples held in arms, eternal peace.

Vaporeon, still in her maid dress, leaned gently forward with a sparkle in her eye, and, without warning, scooped Flareon into her arms again.

“I’m not letting you go the rest of the day...” she teased, adjusting her hold just enough to make it snug.

Flareon, dressed in his butler uniform, sputtered.

“H-Hey! This isn’t part of the...!” He folded his arms and turned his head, blushing.
“...Whatever. Not like I hate it or anything.”

Vaporeon smirked.

“Tsundere confirmed.”

The chamber doors opened with a soft tone, and Gardevoir, still aglow with authority and wisdom, stepped in, her psychic presence mingling with the warmth of the room. She looked around at the joyful mischief of her fellow immortals and at the peaceful replay of Erosbloom-89's surface projected above.

She crossed her arms, satisfied.

“This is what I fought for...” she said calmly. “A solar system where dreams stopped being toxic and started becoming gentle.”

The others nodded, knowing full well: it wasn’t just peace they’d built.

It was a future that no one needed to escape from.

Ch 62: Ungenius Math Descendants of Ninetales

[Scene: Pokeplanet – Present Day, 6.9 Million Light Years from Evoir]
Location: Poketopia (yes, still called that)

Time has pushed forward, billions of years since the golden eras of Ho-Oh’s miracles and the reign of legendaries. The rebirths have ended. True legendaries and mythicals now belong only to the history scrolls. The last of them perished over 2 billion years ago, precisely 390 years after the events of Saga 4.

And yet, Poketopia still stands.

No longer a tourist hub, it is now a fortified, high-security city-state where caution rules policy. After millennia of chaos, it became clear: no divine phoenix would come to undo mistakes anymore.

But hope doesn’t always need revival.

In the educational district on the southern edge, a dual-typed Eeveelution, Fire/Water-type, clad in shimmering Heatran-plated scales, stood at the front of a dome-shaped youth center. Her tail curled neatly, steam rising softly from the contrast of fire and water as she lectured calmly, a holo-slate levitating before her.

This was Heatranvee, descendant of Vaporeon and Flareon, born of Poketopian roots and the gentle principles they’d passed on.

Two young students sat before her, still trembling a little.
A Ground/Dark-type Neonian Piloswine, shaggy and uncertain, and beside her, a more delicate-looking Ice/Psychic Neonian Braixen with crystalline ears and a troubled gaze.

They were cousins, descendants of Greninja x Delphox and Mamoswine x Alolan Ninetales. Despite their powerful bloodlines, their spirits had faltered.

“Our math exam grades dropped off a cliff…” Neonian Braixen mumbled, nearly tearing up.
“We tried to memorize everything, but it just wouldn’t stick.”

Neonian Piloswine nodded slowly, eyes dim.

Heatranvee gave them a patient look, then used her tail to tap the holographic display.

“Because memorization alone isn’t learning...” she said firmly. “You didn't understand the why. That’s the root of good thinking, something more important than any revival.”

She opened a practice exercise not from the exam but from their daily lives, counting soil acidity ratios, predicting steam pressure curves.

Slowly, their eyes began to light up.

Behind them, a wall plaque quietly displayed names of founders and moral pillars: Vaporeon. Flareon. Lil Eve. Keldeo.

Their legacy lived on, if not in miracles, then in small victories.

-

[Scene: Planet Evoir – Chronoscene Reflector Chamber]

The glowing panels cast soft illumination across the round crystal platform. Three immortals sat together, watching the distant feed from Pokeplanet: Alolan Ninetales, ever elegant in her light blue sundress; Vaporeon, tail lazily wrapped around Flareon’s; and Flareon, flopped in her arms again, being quietly carried without protest.

The room was peaceful... until a sigh broke the silence.

“Why is my lineage so mentally fragile sometimes…?” Alolan Ninetales muttered, eyes drifting away from the screen.

“Maybe it's all those brains and no chill...” Flareon shrugged.

Vaporeon poked him in the side.

“Hey. Be nice.”

The doors slid open with a cheerful hum, and Lil Eve floated in like a breeze, still dressed in her iconic schoolgirl seifuku, immortal eyes shining like stars.

“Saw the whole thing already...” she chimed. “That Heatranvee’s doing a great job. You should be proud.”

Alolan Ninetales blinked.

“Still… maybe I should start a math class.”

Lil Eve grinned wider.

“Only if you finally pass your coding test first.”

A beat of silence. Then, 

“Oh please not that again...” Alolan Ninetales groaned, tail drooping as Vaporeon burst into gentle laughter.

Even Flareon cracked a smile as the room shifted from legacy to levity, glowing softly under the starlight of a future still being written.

-

[Scene: Planet Evoir – Chronoscene Reflector Room, Later That Day]

The crystal orb shimmered again, catching everyone's attention as it switched feeds. The peaceful Pokeplanet visuals faded, replaced by an explosion of garish colors and dissonant jingle tunes.

The new feed was live: a drone transmission from NFT777-Enefftia, the infamous casino-planet.

The camera, mounted on a floating scout drone, zipped through the chaotic neon skyline of the gacha-glutted empire. Gaudy banners waved across skyscrapers in pixelated flames and rainbows. Giant screens flashed grotesquely overhyped slogans:

“Draw NOW for a chance at the ultra-rare LEGENDARY HUMAN WAIFU!!”
“SQUARE ROOT SPECIAL EVENT: √((((((((2)))))))) PERCENT CHANCE!”
“NEW NINETALES-THEMED FIGURINE SET, 0.0000003% DROP RATE!!”

Controlling the drone feed remotely were two of the most dangerous minds from the past war: Serenede, the coldly efficient human war strategist, and Enefftian Ninetales, her playful yet cunning vulpine accomplice, herself descended from Alolan Ninetales, yet corrupted by the Enefftian culture of profit and temptation.

They laughed over comms as the banners flickered by, each more absurd than the last.

Inside the Chronoscene Reflector Room, Alolan Ninetales instinctively squinted.

“Oh no...” she muttered. “Not that format again... Who even writes drop rates like that?”

Lil Eve leaned closer, eyes mischievous.

“Come on, do it. Code it. I dare you.”

Alolan Ninetales narrowed her eyes.

“You want me to decode √((((((((2)))))))) just to make a point?”

“Yep.”

“...Fine.”

She pulled out a palm-sized crystal terminal, her tail tapping rhythmically against the floor as she brought up a minimal compiler. Her delicate claws danced across the glowing keys.

Seconds later, she stopped. The result hovered on screen:

≈ 1.41421356% drop rate

Alolan Ninetales stared at it flatly.

“And that's supposed to be exciting?”

Lil Eve smirked.

“Hey, better than 0.0000003%.”

Alolan Ninetales sighed with all the weight of someone who had seen the rise and fall of galaxies.

“How did a descendant of mine end up enabling this?”

Vaporeon peeked over her shoulder and snorted.

“At least they didn’t use imaginary numbers this time.”

Flareon, still being held, tilted his head.

“Give them a week.”

They all groaned in unison.

-

Another spaceship, clearly from the same creators, suddenly dashed in and slammed into the earlier gacha-bannered vessel. This time, the drop rate displayed across its hull was even more grotesque:

√√√√√√√√2

In a synthesized voice, the ship politely announced apologies to any nearby alien species for the previous ship’s existence.

The now-crashed gacha ship spiraled out of control and landed squarely on another of Enefftia’s scam vessels, this one a garish MLM ad ship. It had no passengers, only an unnamed automated controller.

Noting the collision, the MLM ship promptly rerouted itself directly into a drifting asteroid. Its guidance system, confused by the solar system’s magnetic field and unable to detect the invisible local sun, registered no reason to stay.

Back in the Chronoscene Room, Alolan Ninetales stared in silence... then facepalmed.

“My descendants are... actual ‘math genius idiots,’” she muttered.

With a sigh, she typed out the unholy √√√√√√√√2 into her interface and calculated the drop rate.

The result popped up on screen.

“It’s even lower. Just by a bit.” (≈ 1.00271127505% drop rate)

She facepalmed again, ears twitching in mild disbelief.

“I’ve lived for about two billion years to see... this...” she said, dryly. “And somehow, it’s funny.”

-

Alolan Ninetales was still staring blankly at the screen when the door slid open behind her.

She turned, just in time to see Flareon, tightly wrapped in fire-proof and watery ropes, being effortlessly carried in Vaporeon’s arms like a squirming plush toy.

His fluffy tail twitched in protest.
“H-Hey! It’s not like I wanted to be tied up or anything…! I was just trying to, guh, explain logically!” he stammered, looking away with a deep blush.

Vaporeon narrowed her eyes at him. “You were rude to Ninetales.”

Without giving him time to wriggle out of his excuse, she leaned in and kissed him squarely on the cheek, firm, slow, and smug.
“That’s your punishment...” she whispered.

Alolan Ninetales blinked once, then twice. “…You two are unbelievable.”

As if in sync, all three turned their attention back to the glowing math result still lingering on the screen.

√√√√√√√√2 ≈ 1.090507732

There was a long pause.

Flareon, still in Vaporeon’s hold, tilted his head. “That’s… it?”

Vaporeon blinked. “…That’s barely even lower than just √2.”

Alolan Ninetales exhaled a long, dry breath. “Two billion years of wisdom and this is what the galaxy gives me…”

They all silently agreed, this entire mathematical scam thing was stupid. But in a way, tragically hilarious.
