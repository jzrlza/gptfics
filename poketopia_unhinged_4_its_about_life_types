Chapter 1 : The Cold Forbidden Elixir

[Opening Scene: 5 Years After the Bot Invasion]

The snow whispered across the quiet mountain as Alolan Ninetales, dressed in a flowing white sundress with a pleated skirt, stood near the cliffside, enjoying a long-overdue vacation with her husband, Mamoswine. Beneath her paws, buried under decades of frost and debris, lay rusted remains of the fallen Dragobot, its jagged wreckage recently unearthed by a thawing avalanche.

Near the wreckage sat a small, half-frozen vial with an aged label scrawled in ancient ink:
“Arceus Elixir – Drink to become immortal.”

Ninetales tilted her head, squinting at the bottle. “Really? That’s it?” she scoffed, brushing snow from her dress. “Will I become the strongest?” she asked aloud, partly joking, then, with a shrug, downed the elixir in one smooth gulp.

Mere seconds later, Mamoswine attempted to climb the same slope behind her, but his massive body and age worked against him. He lost his footing and tumbled down the icy incline, crying out in pain. Ninetales dashed toward him instinctively, too recklessly.

She slipped on a patch of ice and was impaled through the chest by a massive shard of jagged dripstone jutting from the rocks below, barely saved Mamoswine.

Mamoswine’s eyes widened in horror. “NINETALES!”

But to his utter disbelief, she gasped, winced, and smiled. “Oopsies... you alright? I was such an idiot, sorry.” She giggled weakly. “Bakatales moment…”

He rushed to her side, gently pulling her from the spike. Her bloodstained dress shimmered, and within seconds, her body healed completely, the fabric restored as if untouched. It dawned on both of them: she couldn’t die. Not anymore. The elixir had worked. The immortality was real.

Moments later, a golden ring shimmered into existence as Hoopa arrived through a portal, drawn by the ancient energy that had just awakened.

“One of the six elixirs…” Hoopa muttered, examining the now-empty bottle. “These were meant to be sealed… reserved for only the most sacred emergencies.”

He stared at Ninetales, now brushing snow off her still-pristine dress. “It’s done. It can’t be undone. And Ho-Oh… he doesn’t have long left. Eight years, at most.”

-

[Eight Years Later (13 Years After the Bot Invasion)]

Time marched forward. Mamoswine’s thick coat was now peppered with gray, and his movements had slowed with age. But Alolan Ninetales remained unchanged, her sundress still fluttered gently in the breeze, her beauty untouched by time. Immortal. Unmoving. Unfading.

A gentle knock came at the door of their cozy mountain home.

“Coming!” she called, and opened it to a familiar trio.

“Hey Auntie Tails!” said Lil Eve cheerfully, a teenage Eevee with her mother’s grace and her father’s goofy smile. Behind her stood Vaporeon, now a seasoned lifeguard and part-time aquatic forager, and Flareon, wearing a smart apron and carrying a bag of baked goods, now a full-time chef and part-time blacksmith.

“We brought snowberry pies!” Flareon beamed.

Vaporeon smiled warmly. “And some gifts for your little ones, Piloswine and Alolan Vulpix, right?”

Ninetales chuckled. “They’ll love it. Thank you, both of you.”

Lil Eve tilted her head. “You still look the same, Auntie Tails… even prettier, I think!”

Ninetales forced a laugh, brushing a strand of hair behind her ear. “Thanks, sweetie. Must be the snow.”

Inside, a subtle silence lingered beneath the surface cheer. Vaporeon glanced at her with knowing eyes. Immortality, after all, wasn’t as gentle as the snow made it seem.

Chapter 2 : A New Era of Peace

[Scene: Poketopia: Neo, A New Era of Peace]

The city skyline shimmered beneath a clean sky, where aerial transport glided past solar towers and floating gardens. Human-shaped AI robots, sleek, expressive, and warm in tone, roamed the streets assisting citizens and Pokémon alike. 

They were all products of Duraludon’s genius, now a renowned AI and robotics engineer whose lab stood tall with neon runes tracing its steel limbs like veins of light. 

For thirteen long, peaceful years, the city had known safety, innovation, and harmony.

Families thrived. Vaporeon and Flareon walked side by side, their daughter Lil Eve now a bright, inquisitive teenager learning both survival and kindness. The dark days of the bot invasion were now historical archive footage, a lesson and a scar.

-

[Scene Shift: Old Gravestones Beneath a Crimson Sunset]

Outside the city limits, past the now-defunct battlefield turned into a lush meadow, stood two modest gravestones. One was engraved with a resolute bow and the other a scorched boot: Decidueye and Cinderace, fallen fourteen years ago. Wildflowers had grown around the stones, undisturbed except for one lone visitor.

A shimmering ring swirled open, Hoopa stepped out, solemn for once.

He hovered there in silence, hands folded behind his back, eyes narrowed not in mischief, but memory.

"Fourteen years." he muttered. “Still feels fresh…”

Then, he turned his gaze northeast, where the snowy mountains crowned the horizon. His golden eyes softened with weary respect.

“She figured it out instinctively... that Ninetales. Immortality was never meant for mortals,” he said to no one, “and yet she wears it with grace. A foolish drink. A foolish move. But…”

A faint chuckle escaped his lips, melancholic and wise.

“She saved him. And now he lives longer than he ever would’ve… That dress of hers, heh, not even a scratch on it.”

He looked back at the gravestones.

“…And we, the so-called gods, we can’t touch the Arceus Elixir. Not even sip it. The irony…” His voice tightened. “A drop and we die. No revival. Not even Ho-Oh.”

The wind blew gently, scattering dandelion seeds past his face as if nature itself tried to offer comfort. Hoopa closed the ring and vanished, leaving behind nothing but a ring-shaped impression in the grass and two eternally resting heroes.


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Chapter 3 : Gods were Ambushed 100 years ago

[Flashback – 100 Years Ago | The Cosmic Plane]

Shimmering above the mortal realm, on a tranquil, starlit rift of space known only to the divine, Arceus floated in gentle contemplation. The Creator’s presence pulsed like a heartbeat across the firmament. Standing before him were Mew, her form small yet ancient, and her son Mewtwo, composed but curious. Hoopa hovered near the cosmic portal he had summoned, watching vigilantly.

Arceus looked to Mew with a rare glint of serenity.
“We exist to guide, not to dominate. Immortality… is not infinite if forgotten.”

Mew nodded solemnly. “And yet, your existence gives this plane structure. We are pieces of the same pattern.”

Suddenly, BOOM.

A rupture tore through the plane. A swirling black hole of artificial origin exploded into the realm. Mewtwo was flung into Hoopa’s portal, vanishing unconscious. Hoopa was knocked back, and the celestial plane shook.

Regigigas emerged, draped in brutal tech and clad in malice.
Behind him came Regice, Registeel, and Regirock, each enhanced with armor etched in forbidden glyphs. Soon after, Regieleki and Regidrago encircled Hoopa, cutting off escape.

“Immortality… is wasted on gods with rules,” Regigigas growled. “I will take it… for us.”

Arceus charged, light radiating in a holy pulse. Mew darted to his defense, 
, but was surrounded and bound by the three Regi titans.

Hoopa’s rings cracked as he entered Unbound Form, lashing portals and energy in a desperate defense, barely holding his ground.

But then, the needle.
Forged in shadows, built to pierce the divine.

Regigigas drove it deep into Arceus’ chest.

Time froze.

The Creator cried out, not in pain, but finality. As his form unraveled into radiant dust, six luminous vials materialized from his vanishing core, the Arceus Elixirs.
Each one glowed with life eternal… and a curse.

Mew broke free in anguish and, with Hoopa’s help, unleashed a vortex sealed in an ancient void. The six Regi monsters were sucked in, screaming, sealed beneath the world in a dimensionless prison.

As the rift began to close, a faint ghostly echo of Arceus appeared, whispering to Mew and Hoopa:

“The Elixirs… grant what I once bore…
But beware… they do not heal… they do not forgive…
They are not for gods. They are not for the weak.
Only those who choose the burden… shall survive eternity.”

Mewtwo reappeared, breathless, watching his fallen origin vanish into nothing. He said nothing. No one did.

Hoopa sealed the Elixirs away, high in the frozen mountains, far from legend and light.

-

[Present Day – Earth’s Crust Beneath the North]

A thunderous quake. The old void ruptures.

Six titanic figures step out.

Cracked armor. Red eyes. Ancient fury.
The Regi Six... had returned.

Regigigas cracked its joints and raised its arms high.

“Free... at last. The world has forgotten.
But we will remind it.
Immortality… will make us gods.”

He laughed. Madly. Deeply. Without fear.

“With no death, there is no consequence. And with no consequence, there is no law.”


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Chapter 4 : Psychic Library Visit Pt 1

[Present Day – Poketopia City | Psychic Chapter Begins]

Though danger brewed silently on the opposite side of the world, Poketopia City basked in sunshine and technological serenity. Elevated rail pods zipped between gleaming towers. Holograms danced in the air. Robots, both utilitarian and aesthetic, walked among Pokémon and humans alike in perfect sync.

Mew, floating with casual grace, scrolled through the PokéNet on her sleek touchscreen pad. She smiled.

“Five stars. Espeon’s Library… this place has evolved well.”

She glanced at Mewtwo, who stood beside her in silent observation. Cloaked, his expression was unreadable, but he gave a silent nod. He’d saved many cities under Mew’s quiet requests, often anonymously. This time felt more… personal.

With a ripple of space, Hoopa emerged beside them and opened a swirling ring.

“Your portal to Poketopia awaits! Try not to destroy anything this time, Mewtwo.”

Mew giggled. Mewtwo merely exhaled through his nose.

They arrived.

The city was even more dazzling in person. Neon gardens climbed up smart-glass skyscrapers. Drone-winged Pidgeots soared with style. Beneath all of it stood a majestic art-deco style building, Espeon’s Library.

They stepped inside.

“Welcome,” said Espeon, her violet eyes kind and piercing all at once. Though she now looked like a 40-something grandmother, her coat was still sleek, her expression sharp. “You’ve arrived just in time for quiet hour.”

Beside her, Duraludon, now a respected AI and robotic engineer, bowed slightly. His long, metal frame had subtle upgrades, and a technician’s monocle gleamed on his head fin.

Mew’s eyes twinkled as she floated through the high-vaulted hall.

“This is marvelous… robots working in harmony with knowledge.”

Duraludon’s robotic maid, sleek, humanoid, and wearing a bowtie, offered trays of herbal tea to everyone.

Mewtwo, on the other hand, walked directly up to Espeon and asked flatly:

“Do you have family?”

Espeon blinked, amused. “A granddaughter. She loves singing. You’ll hear her in the music wing sometimes.”

Hoopa hovered nearby, raising an eyebrow.

“She doesn’t look like a grandma.”

Mew laughed with delight. “No wrinkles, no cane, no creaks. I should borrow your skincare routine!”

Mewtwo chuckled, a rare sound.

“This city really is unhinged.”

As they explored, they passed Delphox, who had just closed a book titled Mind Beyond Matter: Advanced Psychic Type Mastery. She was older now, eyes serene, and had two children waiting at home. She offered a gentle nod to the group.

But as she passed by the DNA section, one of the nearby books lit up faintly red in her holo pocket crystal, a subtle flicker, barely noticed.

Curious, she joined the impromptu psychic circle forming at the corner lounge: Espeon, Mew, Mewtwo, and herself.

They began discussing psychic evolution, intergenerational memory, and how emotions affected mind-reading precision. It was peaceful. Civil. Illuminating.

Duraludon’s maid-bots poured more tea. Outside, the sky dimmed into evening. The city’s lights shimmered alive.

-

Far away… beneath the crust… the Regi Six stirred.


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Chapter 5 : Psychic Library Visit Pt 2

[Poketopia Library – Psychic Symposium, Present Day]

It was another vibrant day in Poketopia City. The air smelled like synth-flowers and steaming mochi from automated street stalls. Inside the chrome-and-crystal halls of Espeon’s Library, the psychic types gathered once more.

Gardevoir entered gracefully, giving a fond wave to her Kirlia daughter and Lucario, her husband, before joining the meeting.

From another side, Galarian Rapidash, glowing with mystic elegance, nuzzled her husband Gastrier affectionately. He gave a brief whinny before cantering off to his herd, a harem composed of Spectrier, Mudsdale, Zebstrika, and Kantonian Rapidash. Their shared son, Keldeo, trailed behind his unicorn mother, enchanted by the library’s science and mythology section.

Delphox soon joined with her gifted psychic students. She had waved to Greninja and their Froakie son, who were off to swimming class, while their Braixen daughter simply came to spectate with a popsicle in hand.

At the round table, waiting with a mix of calm and caffeine, sat Espeon (librarian and curator), Mew, Mewtwo, and Hoopa.

| “Let’s begin,” Espeon purred, floating a clipboard made of psychic light.

But before the first topic was spoken, Mewtwo, ever the stoic instigator, suddenly gestured at the ancient holo-timer on the table.

| “Let’s peer through time. I want to see something... primal.”

Delphox’s crystal flickered as the time viewer swirled to life, and soon, the psychics beheld…

-

[1000 Years Ago – Ancient Poketopia Prehistoric Times]

Through the mists of time, they watched:

A hulking male Tyrantrum, wearing a caveman loincloth, thundered through a jungle, chasing a frightened female Aurorus in equally crude cave attire. Her crystals shimmered in fear, but she was clever.

She dashed toward a glade, where a noble being awaited: Koraidon, great-great-grandfather to today’s Miraidon. He knelt, presenting fish he had caught, a peace offering.

Aurorus took the fish gently. Though a vegan, she understood: this was survival. She returned and, with trembling hooves, offered them to the pursuing Tyrantrum.

Tyrantrum, breathing heavily, blinked.

| “You fed me? Not ran? Not fought? …Wife material.”

Aurorus blushed.

| “Feeding is love. Let’s build… something together.”

That moment, recorded by fate, sparked the founding of the very first stone shelter in what would one day become Poketopia, a line that would eventually birth Tyranitar.

Hoopa was stunned. “Did we just watch a censored dinosaur romcom?!”

Everyone was too shocked to speak.

-


[Fast-Forward: 69 Years Ago – The Scam Saga]

The timeline flickered again. This time they saw:

A younger Zapdos, feathered in gold-tinted business attire, hawking a shady immortality “potion” to Type: Null behind a dumpster made of old PC Boxes. Nearby, Rayquaza, suspiciously dressed like a shady guru, tried to upsell a “Dragon Coin” NFT scam.

Articuno, standing beside them in a sleek winter coat, rolled her eyes.

“Disgusting. I’d steal immortality through honest evil, not pyramid schemes.”

Null, however, had enough. He trapped Zapdos in a golden cube. But not before Zapdos activated his moon-sized bomb implant, sealing himself beneath what would become Tyranitar’s Manor.

Rayquaza, left behind, barely survived over the decades, scraping by from duping MLM hopefuls and installing the cursed Timi Timmy Co. logo into his chest.

The scars remained, literally. One shaped like a rocky claw… made him shiver.

-

[28 Years Ago – Darkrai’s Mistake]

Darkrai, still a heartbroken young adult from his Wigglytuff breakup, wandered past. Rayquaza pounced.

“Sign up for this crypto cult and get six stars! …Also immortality.”

Darkrai, vulnerable and debt-ridden, joined.

The rest was unhinged history.

-

[Back to Present – Poketopia Library]

The viewer powered down. Silence fell upon the psychics.

Mew turned to Hoopa. “That was… a lot.”

Hoopa nodded. “I need tea and possibly therapy.”

Mewtwo simply folded his arms.

“So that’s why Rayquaza keeps dying to Tyranitar.”

Gardevoir rubbed her temples. “And Zapdos is worse than we thought.”

Delphox sipped her tea. “I feel like I just read five separate soap operas crammed into one.”

Espeon sighed.

“This timeline is more cursed than I cataloged. But I can’t stop reading.”

Everyone nodded solemnly. Somewhere, Keldeo sneezed in the science wing.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Chapter 6 : The Eight Plates Ceremony

[Poketopia – The Eight Plates Ceremony]

The ancient vision had left the psychic types deep in thought. But there was little time to reflect. The threat of the Regi Six loomed, and the Arceus Elixirs still held dangerous mysteries.

Then, in the shimmering heart of the library, Hoopa appeared again, this time with a solemn expression and arms full of glowing artifacts.

“It’s time,” Hoopa said. “The Plates must return to the ones who still carry Arceus’ intent. Especially... to her.”

He floated the Psychic Plate toward Espeon, whose eyes widened.

Delphox, standing nearby, closed her book and whispered, “It’s her time. Your granddaughter, Lil Eve… she must inherit all eight elemental virtues. Only then will she be ready.”

Espeon trembled. “Lil Eve… is ready?”

Delphox nodded. “She’s the spark that bridges every path. The child of two elements, descended from hope and flame.”

-

[Over the Next Days – The Plates Are Passed On]

One by one, Hoopa visited the city's most trusted and legendary Eeveelutions, each of whom had touched Lil Eve’s life in some way:

- The Dark Plate was given to Doctor Umbreon, Espeon’s loyal husband, as he exited his shift at the nocturnal clinic.

- The Fire Plate was handed to Flareon, Lil Eve’s father, while he worked in the city’s geothermal greenhouse cooking there.

- The Water Plate went to Vaporeon, Lil Eve’s gentle mother, beside the tranquil memorial lake where Decidueye and Cinderace’s stones stood.

- The Ice Plate was delivered to Glaceon, Vaporeon’s wise mother, found meditating under frozen waterfalls in the Winter Gardens.

- The Grass Plate was given to Leafeon, her serene grandfather, tending to bonsai forests on floating tree platforms.

- The Electric Plate was entrusted to Officer Jolteon, her protective uncle figure, fresh off disabling a rogue vending bot.

- The Fairy Plate went to Sylveon, her elegant aunt figure and a schoolteacher known for nurturing young minds with poetry and song.

And at last, all eight gathered under one roof, the grand skylit Library of Poketopia.

Lil Eve stood at the center, glowing faintly with inner light, the Plates arranged around her like petals.

-

[The Ceremony – Words from Urshifu]

Stepping forward from the gathering crowd came Urshifu, a wanderer of myth, flanked by his friends Zeraora and Sceptile, both nodding in silent respect.

Urshifu addressed Lil Eve with a voice like thunder in rain:

“You stand on the path of life types, not just in name, but in soul. To master all eight is to understand the world beyond combat. Listen well…”

He raised his paw as each Plate shimmered.

- Grass: “Tests balance. Without harmony in temperature, nothing grows. You must learn when to yield and when to root.”

- Water: “Tests direction. Flow without panic. Swim not just with strength, but purpose.”

- Fire: “Tests temper. Fire creates, warms, comforts, when you will it, not when you lose it.”

- Ice: “Tests preservation. Calm yourself, even when everything slips away.”

- Fairy: “Tests the art of presence. Beauty, kindness, and charm, they shape how others feel your power.”

- Dark: “Tests justice. Not all that’s right is gentle. Learn to see through shadows, and strike without cruelty.”

- Psychic: “Tests wisdom. See the unseen. Solve the puzzle that is yourself.”

- Electric: “Tests speed and consequence. A surge gives life, or ends it. Control the charge within.”

Lil Eve, silent and steady, bowed. She understood. These are not just types, they are ways to live.

Urshifu smiled, placing his paw over her heart.

| “You are not your powers. You are what you do with them.”

With a nod to Espeon and Flareon, he turned. Zeraora and Sceptile were already waiting. As the three legends vanished into golden sparks, the library was left in reverent silence.

Lil Eve closed her eyes. The journey had begun.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Chapter 7 : Type Trials Pt 1 Grass

[Trial of Grass – The Gracious Balance]

In the steamy comfort of the old fountain house, built during her parents' university days, Lil Eve stretched her limbs and let the warm mist swirl around her. The memories of her family surrounded her in the architecture, the stone etchings, and the ivy crawling up the outer windows.

She tapped her holo pendant.

“Grandpa Leafeon? I want to start with Grass. I feel… ready.”

Moments later, her call was answered. Leafeon's calm, leaf-scented voice replied.

“Then let the roots of your journey begin.”

The next morning, Lil Eve arrived at the newly transformed garden arena. Tsareena, now married to Trevenant, had turned her once-private estate garden into a living classroom. Their children, a spry Steenee and a playful little Planthump, toddled between vines and flowerbeds.

A graceful yet vibrant assembly of Grass Pokémon gathered to witness and guide the trial:

- Leafeon, poised with wisdom in his tail flicks.

- Tsareena, regal and proud.

- Trevenant, standing rooted like a sage.

- Venusaur, blooming with authority.

- Roserade, elegantly attentive.

- Lilligant, accompanied by her curious Petilil daughters.

- Meowscarada, twirling her mask as her Sprigatito son purred beside her.

- Sceptile, arms crossed, eyes sharp as blades.

- Chesnaught, stoic and silent.

- Eldegoss, floating gently like pollen on a breeze.

At the center of the garden, a young berry tree sapling rested inside a decorative soil pot. Around it, nutrient beds had been tilled and prepared, awaiting Lil Eve’s decision.

Lil Eve held her book tight, Temperature and Photosynthesis: A Study of Growth.

Venusaur spoke first, rumbling in his baritone:

“Without fertilizer, your roots will be thirsty.”

Meowscarada chimed in with a sly smirk:

“You’ll want this done before the sunlight dips. Grass doesn’t wait for the moon.”

Sceptile cracked his neck.

“This is a trial of balance, not just action. Place it right, or it won't bloom.”

Trevenant nodded and stepped forward.

“I shall be your gauge. My bark feels heat and cold. Listen well, too hot, and it’ll wilt. Too cold, and it’ll sleep.”

Lil Eve moved slowly, shifting the berry tree pot across the garden with concentration. Each time, Trevenant murmured:

“Too cold.”
“Too hot.”
“Still too warm…”

It wasn’t until Eldegoss floated by and smiled, pointing with a gust of fluff, that Lil Eve noticed a perfect patch, dappled light, breezy shade, and slightly raised ground.

“Right here,” Lil Eve whispered.

She knelt, mixing the organic fertilizer gently into the soil, and watered the roots with steady care. Then, one by one, the Grass Pokémon stepped forward, channeling their power into the plant.

Leaves danced. Light shimmered. Petals bloomed.

The sapling exploded with life, shooting upward with vines, berries, and blossoms in seconds.

Leafeon approached and placed the Grass Plate before her. It shimmered, then pulsed, and a small shard broke off into a Mini Leaf Stone, merging into Lil Eve’s chest like a heartbeat.

Green vines circled her arms and shoulders, becoming the Grassy Vines, a living tether she could now control like a grappling hook in warm, balanced environments.

Her coat shimmered green, mimicking her grandfather’s fur, leaf-tail and all. She blinked, and with focus, returned to her base Eevee form. Her eyes sparkled with potential.

“One down,” Leafeon said with a warm smile. “The wilds will no longer fear you. You’ve learned to grow, not just survive.”

The garden applauded in rustling leaves.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Chapter 8 : Type Trials Pt 2 Water

[Trial of Water – The Test of Flow and Depth]

Later that evening, as the moon cast ripples of silver across the glassy windows, Lil Eve sat curled up in her towel robe, brushing her damp fur. The steam from the bath still clung faintly to her.

She turned to her mother, who was humming softly while drying her fins.

“Mom… I’m ready for the Water element. Can we do it tomorrow?”

Vaporeon blinked, then smiled gently.

“Of course, my dear. I’ll let someone special know.”

In the kitchen, Flareon stirred a sizzling pot of berry stew. He gave a thumbs-up with a ladle.

“I’ll make sure dinner helps you breathe underwater.”

The next morning, Greninja stood at the gates of his luxurious and eccentric aquatic complex, a training pool unlike any other. Its twisting canals and submerged chambers were built for stealth… and mystery. Hidden compartments, swirling currents, and oxygen bubble traps filled the watery maze.

Gathered in solemn purpose (and some excitement) were a lineup of veteran Water-types:

- Vaporeon, calm and maternal.

- Greninja, sleek and focused.

- Blastoise, arms crossed, water cannons gleaming.

- Gyarados, looming in his trench of currents.

- Slowbro, staring at nothing in particular.

- Psyduck, proudly unevolved and holding his head.

- Primarina, graceful as ever, humming notes that swayed the water.

- Azumarill, bouncing with energy beside her waterproof guitar.

- Inteleon, cool and smug, sipping from a glass.

- Swampert, flexing in silence with a grunt.

- Lapras, elegant and kind.

- Suicune, now elderly but dignified, her presence a safeguard.

“I’m here… to make sure no one sinks too far,” she said softly.

Lil Eve, now equipped with a custom aqua suit, breathing gear, and her newly awakened Grassy Vines, awaited her task.

Vaporeon stepped forward.

“This is not a battle of strength. This is a test of direction, rhythm… and breath. Deliver these items. One at a time. No shortcuts.”

She handed Eve a delivery bag. The test began.

-

Round One – Shallow Route

- A stainless ninja helmet for Greninja – smooth delivery, no issues.

- A fire extinguisher for Blastoise – amusing, but easy.

- A waterproof guitar for Azumarill – she squealed with joy and strummed a splashy tune.

Round Two – Moderate Currents

Here, the tunnels twisted tighter, and subtle whirlpools formed.

- A meal of Veluza fillet for Gyarados – Eve used her Grassy Vines to slingshot herself safely through.

- A precious pearl to Primarina – who accepted it with a song.

- A liquor bottle to Inteleon – he smirked and toasted her silently.

- A dumbbell to Swampert – he grunted approval.

Round Three – The True Test

Currents thickened. The water dimmed. Eve felt the pull of exhaustion creeping in.

- A memory card to Slowbro – who was so still, Eve nearly missed him.

- More Veluza meals to Psyduck – who panicked and nearly swam into a wall.

- A boat ticket for Lapras – in the deepest section, blocked by shifting tunnels.

Just as Lil Eve began to tire, struggling for breath, Suicune appeared and placed an air bubble gently over her.

“You’ve done enough. Let the current carry you up now.”

She rose slowly through the water, surfacing to gasps of fresh air and applause from above.

Vaporeon, waiting at the edge of the pool with trembling paws, rushed to her daughter and embraced her tightly.

“You did it! You really did it…!”

She handed Lil Eve the Water Plate. Like before, it pulsed, this time, glowing like moonlit waves. A Mini Water Stone broke off and merged into Lil Eve's chest.

Water swirled around her body, manifesting the Surf Waterfall ability. She could now generate clean surges of water to cross rivers, ascend streams, and cool her body in moments of stress.

Her fur shimmered a translucent blue, echoing her mother’s sleek design. With a shimmer, she returned to Eevee form, giggling.

“That was amazing, Mom.”

Vaporeon, overwhelmed with pride, teared up, her emotions causing an unintended flood of salty water to pour into the pool.

“Mom, stop, Greninja’s yelling!”
Greninja was already hopping around in panic.
“That’s my water filtration system!!”

Everyone burst into laughter as Suicune sighed and summoned gentle winds to clean up the flood.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Chapter 9 : Type Trials Pt 3 Fire

[Trial of Fire – The Test of Temper and Creation]

That night, the steam of bathwater still trailing off their bodies, Lil Eve and her mother Vaporeon arrived home, both soaked but smiling. As they shook off the water at the doorstep, the rich scent of roasted berries and grilled Vesula meat drifted from the kitchen.

Flareon, tail ablaze and eyes focused, had just plated dinner.

“Dad,” Lil Eve said, stepping closer, “I think I’m ready for the Fire challenge next.”

He looked up, his grin wide and flame flickering brighter.

“You? Fired up already?”
“Fired up as ever.”
“Then I guess it’s time.”

He pulled out his communicator.

“Charizard, we’ve got a firestarter.”

-

The next morning, they arrived at the BlazeGrill Neo branch, a fire-type communal kitchen built beside a geothermal greenhouse, perfect for both cooking and forging.

A group of Fire-types, already crackling with energy, gathered for the occasion:

- Flareon, proud and puffed.

- Charizard, wings spread wide.

- Blaziken, intense as always.

- Delphox, calm and sharp-eyed.

- Incineroar, roaring with his little Litten daughter in tow.

- Chandelure, floating with eerie flames.

- Salazzle, lounging with a knowing smirk.

- Tysplosion, just inspecting and waiting for results in spikey excitement.

- Talonflame, soaring in circles above.

- Ho-Oh, radiant and regal despite his age, perched calmly in the background.

Lil Eve looked around nervously.

“So… I’m cooking?”

Flareon nodded.

“Today, fire is your forge. Your challenge is to use these tools, chef’s gear and blacksmith sets, to prepare dishes using berries, veggies, and Vesula meat. But mind the lava furnace. Fire creates… but it destroys just as fast.”

-

First Test – The Spice Gauntlet

Blaziken casually popped a blazing red chili into his beak. No sweat.

Talonflame and Charizard followed suit, flames sparking from their mouths. Even Ho-Oh did it, eyes shimmering with nostalgia.

Lil Eve stared at her own chili, eyes watering already.

“Dad… how?!”

Without hesitation, Flareon chomped his chili clean in half.

“It’s all about the burn... and the control.”

Gritting her teeth, Lil Eve did the same, then squealed and sprinted to the back kitchen. Her Surf Waterfall ability instinctively activated, dousing her mouth and creating a puddle that nearly extinguished Chandelure, who screeched and hovered away, dripping.

-

Second Test – The Flame of Focus

With the help of the kitchen forge, Lil Eve prepared orders under pressure:

- Blaziken requested spicy corn-berry fries – a success.

- Delphox and Chandelure wanted fruit & fish skewers, spiced.

 -- She nearly burned the fish, but saved it in time.

- Incineroar and Salazzle asked for charred Vesula cuts.

 -- The flames flared too high.

 -- She reflexively used Surf Waterfall, dousing the fire just before disaster.

“Pffft,” Incineroar chuckled, inspecting the half-burnt meat.
“You know, I did this every week back when I was learning. You’re doing great.”

Reassured, Lil Eve focused hard and nailed the remaining orders. Her final creation was a flaming spice soufflé for Ho-Oh, who took one bite and sighed in delight, feathers glowing warmly.

-

As the flames settled, Flareon stepped forward, eyes bright with pride.

“You passed. Fire’s not just heat. It’s temper, timing, and transformation.”

He held out the Fire Plate. It pulsed in her paws, then released a glowing Mini Fire Stone, which melted gently into her fur.

Flames danced along her back briefly, her coat shifting to match her father's burning hues. She felt her body grow heat-resistant, and her instincts unlock a new move:

Flamethrower Trail – leaving blazing paths behind her, capable of melting ice, searing grass, and igniting new possibilities. The flames burned brighter when fueled by spicy food.

She beamed.

“Wow… I feel like a walking bonfire!”

Suddenly, POOF!, she had accidentally dropped a raw Vesula steak too close to her trail. It turned to ashes.

“Oops.”

“And now you’ve learned the final fire lesson,” Flareon smirked.
“Don’t overdo it.”

Everyone laughed, even Chandelure, who still hovered a little farther away than usual.

Chapter 10 : Type Trials Pt 4 Ice

[Trial of Ice – The Parkour of Madness]

That evening, Vaporeon waited at home with extra water bottles stacked like a fortress, just in case. The door swung open to reveal Flareon carrying a soot-covered stew pot and Lil Eve, who coughed up a tiny puff of smoke, face red but triumphant.

“She can handle spicy now,” Flareon grinned.
“Mostly,” Eve wheezed.

Once hydrated, Lil Eve called her icy grandmother Glaceon through the holo-comm.

“Grandma, I want to try the Ice Element next.”

Glaceon’s frosty expression didn’t budge.

“Are you sure? Mine’s not a trial. It’s cold hell.”

“I’m sure.”

-

The Next Morning

They arrived at a massive sub-zero arena known as The Frozen Maw, a sprawling vertical dungeon made of icy platforms, rotating lifts, and bone-chilling wind tunnels. It was Alolan Ninetales' pet project, constructed using her Hourai-style immortality and zero concern for sanity.

“I call it Parkour of the Permafrost!” Ninetales said proudly.
“She fell off it 136 times while building it,” said her grumbling husband Mamoswine, who kindly installed anti-fall-damage cushions across the dungeon.
“I’m fine!” Ninetales shouted from halfway up the tower.
“She always survives,” added Lapras, unimpressed.
Weavile, watching nearby, shrugged. “She’s not wrong.”

Also present were:

- Glaceon, observing coolly.

- Alolan Ninetales, clearly too into this.

- Mamoswine, the reluctant builder.

- Lapras and her friend Weavile, here to support (and mock) as needed.

-

The Ice Trial Begins

Dressed in a winter coat and skirt, Lil Eve stepped onto the first platform. It immediately began tilting and sliding. The ice was treacherous. Some platforms looked solid but collapsed if stepped on, others were only stable if burned into firmer shapes.

She carefully climbed, platform by platform. Her Flamethrower Trail skill proved vital, she used it to melt and refreeze unstable panels into walkable surfaces, even dodging wind gusts and slippery tilts that threatened to yeet her into the padded abyss.

After a grueling ascent, she reached the snowy peak. Alolan Ninetales leapt in joy, then immediately slipped off and tumbled back to the bottom.

“I’m okay!” she shouted from below.

“You go congratulate her,” Weavile told Lapras.
“Again,” sighed Mamoswine.

-

Glaceon stepped forward, nodding approvingly.

“You made it. Through madness and frostbite.”

She handed over the Ice Plate, which shimmered in her paws and transformed into a glowing Mini Ice Stone, merging into her. Her coat now gleamed in Glaceon’s color palette, and she gained:

- Cold and slip resistance

- Frost Print – the power to conjure and 3D-print icicle sculptures for tools, weapons, or art.

But peace was short-lived.

-

[Interruption – The Scam from Regice]

Unbeknownst to all, high above the arena, Articuno had been lazily watching the entire parkour course from her icy throne cloud, munching on frozen grapes.

Her phone buzzed.

Regice (ID spoofed): “Hello, this is the Free Icicle Challenge Reward Hotline. Please provide your credit card, and an image of the arena’s destruction for... bonus payment.”

Articuno blinked.

“What kind of amateur scam, ?”

But before she could hang up, she paused.

“Eh. I won’t get my wings dirty.”

She flipped through a stolen blueprint from Duraludon and assembled a chilling creation:

Articuno-Bot.

-

Articuno-Bot Descends

Without warning, the bot crashed into the dungeon, freezing Lil Eve’s lower body in a block of ice. Glaceon leapt to defend her, but the bot unleashed a Blizzard Pulse, blasting Mamoswine, Lapras, and Weavile into unconsciousness.

Alolan Ninetales, still dusting herself off from her fall, sprang into action.

“Keep your eyes on me, metalhead!”

She smashed into the bot with Dazzling Gleam, then raised ice walls to block its movements.

“Eve! Fireball it! Don’t worry about me, I don’t stay dead!”

The bot jabbed her with an icy spike, but she grinned through it.

“Ow. Worth it.”

Eve ignited, melting herself free with Flamethrower Trail, then spun a blazing arc straight into the Articuno-Bot’s chest. The ice cracked, shattered, and the bot exploded in a burst of wires and cold.

Ninetales dove out of the flames just in time, steaming slightly, then magically regenerated with a sparkle.

“Still immortal,” she smirked.

-

[Epilogue: The Scam Fallout]

Back on her cloud, Articuno threw her phone.

“REGICE! You idiot!”

She tried calling back. No response.

Fuming, she printed dozens of anti-scam call posters, “Don’t Trust Regice!”, and began plastering them across the sky.

But before she could even finish, a mischievous Electabuzz swooped in, stole her Duraludon schematics, and ran off with a picture of her fallen brother Zapdos taped to his back.

Articuno sighed.

“Today’s just not my day.”

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Chapter 11 : Type Trials Pt 5 Fairy

[Trial of Fairy – The Art of Light and Heart]

After the intense Ice trial, Lil Eve took a well-earned day to rest. That afternoon, she visited the elegant Galarian Rapidash Manor, where her Frost Print ice sculptures immediately caught the attention of Galarian Rapidash and her stoic husband Gastrier.

“Impressive work,” Gastrier said with a nod.
“Cute,” Rapidash added with a grin, “but there’s more to Fairy than ice and form. Are you ready for what’s next?”

Curious, Lil Eve called her old high school teacher that night, Sylveon, a bright and kind trans woman who taught her creative arts back in the day.

“Fairy challenge? Now we’re talking!” Sylveon beamed. “Lucky for you, it’s semester break.”

Sylveon made a quick call to Rapidash, and by the next morning, the manor’s grand studio had transformed into a gathering of Fairy spirits.

-

Present were:

- Sylveon, the heart of the event.

- Galarian Rapidash, hosting the trial.

- Gardevoir, elegant and poised.

- Alolan Ninetales, still immortal and curious about Eve’s new Frost Print.

- Alcremie, gently hovering like whipped mist.

- Wigglytuff, quiet but attentive.

- Zacian, watching from a garden window.

- Tinkaton, wild-eyed and hammer-ready, alongside her Tinkatuff daughter.

- Comfey, wrapping herself around Tinkaton like a living accessory.

- Mimikyu, silently lurking near the tea set.

- Primarina and Azumarill, both floating gently in a massive enchanted tank.

“This isn’t a battle,” Sylveon told Lil Eve. “This is about soul, beauty, and friendship. An art class of the heart.”

-

Test 1: Fashion of the Mind

The first challenge was to design a fashion illustration inspired by Gardevoir.
Lil Eve’s initial sketch was… off.

“Too much fluff, too little grace,” Gardevoir said gently. “Elegance isn’t loud, it’s composed.”

Taking that to heart, Eve tried again, this time, designing a Tinkaton bridal dress with sharp edges and delicate embroidery.

“Too pretty,” Tinkaton said bluntly, and smashed it with her hammer.
“...Fair,” Eve muttered.

But from the shards, inspiration sparked. Using Frost Print, Eve sculpted the water and fragments into a crystalized bridal version of Tinkaton. Comfey floated down and wrapped it in flower chains.

-

Test 2: Harmony in Contrast

Alolan Ninetales stood dramatically in the middle of the room.

“I’m the strongest,” she declared.

Wigglytuff, sitting nearby with her usual blank face, blinked once. “Okay.”

Eve sculpted again, this time capturing Ninetales twirling joyfully in her current dress, singing under soft snowflakes, while Wigglytuff stood beside her in a cute sailor uniform, holding hands.

“Is that… me?” Wigglytuff whispered.
“In a sailor outfit?” Ninetales added, staring.

Wigglytuff gave a thumbs-up.

“I love it.”

Even Ninetales teared up a little. “That’s… adorable.”
Sylveon and Rapidash exchanged a nod. They knew she was ready.

-

Final Test: Sculpture of Soul

The last task was to create a piece that reflected pure friendship.

Eve closed her eyes, channeling her emotions, and used Frost Print one last time. Slowly, she sculpted a tall scene: Sylveon and Galarian Rapidash, wearing frilly saddles and pastel dresses, sitting side by side on a cliff. The sun dipped behind them. At the base were words etched in icy calligraphy:

"Friendship is Magic."

The room fell silent.

Sylveon clutched her heart.

“You remembered…”

Rapidash smiled softly. “That was our first play together. Before we became who we are now.”

-

Fairy Plate Acquired

Sylveon stepped forward and handed Lil Eve the Fairy Plate, which transformed into a glowing Mini Fairy Oval that fused gently into her.

Lil Eve now gained:

- Dazzling Gleam – emits radiant light in dark zones, capable of stunning or blinding opponents.

- A coat that matches Sylveon's soft pink and pastel blue when the ability is active.

Just then, Gastrier returned from the garden and paused at the sight of the sculptures.

“...Who made all these?”
“Your daughter-in-law,” Rapidash said proudly.

Gastrier’s eyes widened just slightly.

“I’m impressed.”

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Chapter 12 : Type Trials Pt 6 Dark

[Trial of Dark – Shadows of Judgment]

Later that night, Gardevoir walked Lil Eve home, quietly impressed by her new stylish police uniform, a sleek top paired with a pencil skirt and matching cap.

“You wear confidence well,” Gardevoir said with a smile.

Back home, Vaporeon welcomed her with cold water while Flareon proudly served a spicy dinner. Once settled, Lil Eve gathered her courage and called the one relative she still found difficult to approach, her stern, stoic grandfather:

Dr. Umbreon.

The old Umbreon picked up the call with his usual calm tone.

“My test,” he said, “isn’t for soft hearts. It’s not about empathy. It’s about judgment. Cold, rational judgment.”

Lil Eve hesitated, but curiosity, and stubborn pride, pushed her forward.

“I’ll do it,” she said with a gulp.

Flareon gave her a warm pat on the back.

“He’s nicer than he looks… sometimes.”

Umbreon then called an old enemy-turned-ally, Tyranitar.

“We’ll do this right,” Umbreon assured. “No Darkrai. No chaos. Just clarity.”

By the next day, a trial was ready.

Gathered in the shadows of Tyranitar's underground arena were:

- Umbreon himself

- Tyranitar, calm and massive

- Absol, with whom Lil Eve already felt at ease

- Zoroark, brooding in a corner

- Sableye, decked in full armor, proudly holding a sign reading “No Darkrai Allowed”

- Incineroar, warming up

- Meowscarada, lying on a tree stump

- Greninja, silent as always

- Weavile, tapping her claws

- Urshifu (Single Strike), meditating in stillness

Lil Eve approached and squinted at Sableye’s sign.

“What’s with that…?”
“Don’t ask,” Umbreon replied dryly.

Umbreon then addressed the group.

“Each of you, into the maze. You know your roles. Sableye, you’re her foil.”

Lil Eve gulped. “Maze?”

“A trial of judgment,” Umbreon said. “No kindness. Only decisions.”

He then caught Sableye mid-swipe of someone’s snacks and calmly Foul Played him into a wall, luckily cushioned by the armor.

“See? Violence isn’t always wrong,” Umbreon said. “When it’s earned.”

-

Dark Trial – Begin

The maze was dim and eerie, its doors layered to give Sableye time to set up new “scenes.”

Room 1:
Absol and Sableye are just playing cards.
Eve greets them politely and walks away.
The room lights up green.

Room 2:
Sableye is stealing a jungle blossom from Meowscarada, who lazily watches without chasing.
Eve frowns and walks away.
Red light.

“...Only 80% needed,” Sableye whispered from the shadows. “No stress.”

Room 3:
Incineroar’s lunch is stolen.
Lil Eve narrows her eyes, and strikes Sableye with Dazzling Gleam.
Sableye is flung across the room, gives a thumbs-up from the floor.
Green light.

Room 4:
Sableye is gently cleaning Tyranitar’s stone back.
Eve leaves. Green light.

Room 5:
Sableye is buzzing around Zoroark, irritating her.
Eve gives him another dazzling slap. Green.

Room 6:
Sableye is sweeping dust directly into Weavile’s face.
Eve zaps him again. Green.

Room 7:
Sableye waves a feather in front of Urshifu’s meditating face.
One more zap. Green.

Final Room:
Sableye appears to be "drowning" Greninja in a shallow pool.

Eve pauses... then smiles.

“You can’t drown a Water-type ninja.”

She walks away. The room lights green.

-

Trial Complete

Umbreon meets her at the exit, unreadable as always.

“You chose well. You hesitated where needed. You struck when right.”

He holds out the Dark Plate, which morphs into the Mini Moon Stone and fuses into her.

Lil Eve now gains:

- Pulsive Foul Play – A slap infused with mind-numbing force, scaling with the opponent’s own strength.

- Her coat can now shift to resemble Umbreon’s: dark navy with glowing rings when the ability is active.

As the group gathers again, Sableye sneaks behind Umbreon to stick a “Kick Me” note on his back.

Without missing a beat, Lil Eve taps Pulsive Foul Play and slaps him into the floor, again.

Sableye, from the floor:

“Totally worth it.”
Umbreon smirks.
Urshifu nods silently in approval.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Chapter 13 : Type Trials Pt 7 Psychic

[Trial of Psychic – The Library of Minds]

Later that evening, after drinking chilled water served by her mom Vaporeon and enjoying a warm dinner freshly made by her dad Flareon, Lil Eve picked up her phone and called her elegant, calm-spoken grandmother: Espeon, the revered librarian of psychic knowledge.

“I believe you’re ready,” Espeon said with a serene voice. “I’ll contact Metagross. He’ll prepare the archive.”

That night, Metagross began transforming his vast archival house into a labyrinth of logic and mental puzzles.

-

Next Day – The Gathering of Minds

Awaiting Lil Eve at the entrance to the puzzle dungeon were the assembled Psychic-types:

- Espeon – composed and graceful

- Metagross – analytical and firm

- Delphox – cryptic but wise

- Gardevoir – serene and focused

- Galarian Rapidash – stylish and ethereal

- Slowbro – absentminded, yet somehow aware

- Psyduck – confused but full of surprises

- Mew – whimsical and bouncy

- Mewtwo – intense, dramatic

- Hoopa – chaotic with mischief

Hoopa floated in first, handing Eve a weird map with arrows that shifted as she walked.

“You’ll have to find your own way in,” Hoopa smirked. “I made it fun. Probably.”

As she reached the main hall, Espeon and Metagross formally greeted her.

“Welcome,” Espeon said. “This trial is one of perception, logic, and discipline.”

“Also,” Slowbro chimed in, “some puzzles might be total bullcrap. Just a heads-up.”

“...Yeah,” Psyduck nodded, strangely lucid for once.

-

The Trial Begins

Lil Eve moved from room to room:

- Espeon’s riddle was elegant and logical, a warm-up.

- Delphox’s puzzle involved weaving symbols into narrative, like a myth.

- Gardevoir made a fashion-based diagram logic test.

- Mew created a shape-shifting memory test, bouncing on her head in delight.

- Galarian Rapidash’s test was aesthetic-based, match the art to the emotion.

- Hoopa’s early room was a shifting portal quiz. Still solvable.

Lil Eve passed them with effort… until she entered Mewtwo’s room.

“Divide by zero,” the wall said.
“What?” she blinked.
“Using negative factorials.”
“WHAT?”

Mewtwo smirked smugly… until Eve simply used Pulsive Foul Play to slap the wall, skipping the entire “puzzle.” The wall broke. The path opened.

“What the, ? That’s illegal!” Mewtwo gasped.
“It’s pragmatic,” Eve replied. “Grandpa Umbreon’s style.”

Next came a room with two puzzles:

- Slowbro’s made no sense.

- Psyduck’s, shockingly, was clever and elegant.

“Don’t underestimate the Psy,” he said, adjusting his head.

Then came Hoopa’s main portal trial, a swirling mess of chaotic logic and paradoxes that defied any reasoning.

“I call this one ‘Seven Choices That Loop Back Into Each Other.’” Hoopa beamed.

Eve didn’t even try.
She slapped the nearest portal with Pulsive Foul Play.
The entire thing collapsed.

“Fair,” Hoopa muttered, spinning out.

-

Final Room – Metagross’ Core Puzzle

The final door revealed Metagross’s signature challenge: a massive mind-labyrinth made of shifting tiles, numbers, and psychic frequencies.

Eve tried brute-forcing it with her dark-type slap. No effect.

“This one,” Metagross said over intercom, “requires thought.”

After a long session of trial, error, frustration, and brain-numbing focus, Eve solved the final array.

-

Psychic Gift

As the final door slid open, Espeon awaited her with a proud smile.

“You’ve grown. Not all problems are meant to be punched, but knowing which ones are… is true wisdom.”

She floated forward and gifted Eve the Psychic Plate, which formed into a glowing Mini Sun Stone that fused into her.

New Ability: Psybeam Focus

- Can fire a precise mental beam

- Can levitate and manipulate objects

- Can create minor localized tremors

- While active, Eve’s coat gains a radiant pink glow, similar to Espeon’s aura

“Use this gently,” Espeon said. “Precision can be more powerful than brute force.”

One of Espeon’s tea-serving maid robots brought a tray for both of them. Lil Eve took a deep breath, sipping her tea beside her proud grandmother.

As the Psychic-types returned to Espeon’s library for their scheduled “Psychics’ Night Out,” Lil Eve stretched and quietly headed back home, another trial passed, and her mind sharper than ever.


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Chapter 14 : Type Trials Pt 8 Electric

[Trial of Electricity – The Thunder Circuit]

Later that evening, after drinking fresh water brought by her mom Vaporeon and enjoying a hearty dinner prepared by her dad Flareon, Lil Eve picked up her phone and called someone dear, her honorary uncle and longtime family friend, Officer Jolteon.

Jolteon picked up in a rush.

“What’s wrong? Emergency?”

“No, no, I’m fine!” Eve giggled. “I’m asking if… you could help me with the Electric Trial.”

Flareon and Vaporeon overheard and were instantly hyped.

“Take good care of her, alright?” Flareon barked.

“Let her shine, but not short-circuit!” Vaporeon teased.

Jolteon, amused and proud, agreed. That night, he called in a favor from his old ally Miraidon, asking him to gather a special crew at Miraidon’s techno manor.

-

The Next Day – Thunder Gathering

Lil Eve arrived at the futuristic estate where several Electric-types awaited her:

- Jolteon, charged and vigilant

- Miraidon, sleek and composed

- Kantonian Raichu, now a matured Pikachu from past adventures

- Alolan Raichu, his spirited wife, along with their energetic Pichus

- Zeraora, who once was hot-headed but now deeply respected Jolteon and Eve’s parents

- Zebstrika, just spectating in excitement

“Welcome to the Electric Trial,” Jolteon announced. “You’ll need brains, balance, and control.”

-

The Circuit Challenges Begin

The trial focused on circuit management, restoring power through careful routing and adjustment:

1. Powering Kantonian Raichu’s Game Console
– Easy. A warm-up. Eve aligned the nodes quickly.
– “Works like old days,” K. Raichu chuckled.

2. Zeraora’s Meditation Radio
– Trickier. The circuit was riddled with traps and false paths.
– With Psybeam Focus, Eve gently triggered micro-quakes to reset bad connections.
– Zeraora watched, impressed.

“Mental clarity with muscle. I like that.”

3. Alolan Raichu’s Toaster
– Delicate. Too much power could break it.
– Eve carefully modulated the flow, using psychic levitation to fine-tune voltage.
– Toast successful. Raichu family cheered.

4. The Electric Car Circuit to Miraidon
– Eve had to reroute a full vehicle system to reach Miraidon waiting at the in-house racetrack’s end.
– With Psybeam Focus, she smoothly powered the car and sped through the track, circuits glowing around her.

At the top of the manor, Jolteon jumped down from Miraidon’s back as she arrived.

“You did well, kid.”

He handed her the Electric Plate, which transformed into a Mini Thunder Stone. It absorbed into her chest, sparking with brilliance.

-

New Ability: Electro Drift

- Dash at lightning speed

- Electrify objects and surroundings

- Gain temporary resistance to Electric damage

- While active, her fur pattern glows with Jolteon’s yellow-and-white color scheme

-

Sudden Interruption – The Envious Eye

Far away, hidden in a worn-down apartment, Electabuzz stared at the event feed in envy. Struggling with debt, he picked up a shady call, from none other than Regieleki, unaware and distant, claiming:

“Wreck circuits. Take pictures. Get rich.”

Desperate, Electabuzz launched his new project, Zapdos-Bot, a volatile machine built from stolen parts and shady blueprints.

Zapdos-Bot stormed into the manor. A flash surge knocked Miraidon and Jolteon off the roof, but both landed safely using their agility.

Eve retaliated, gripping Zapdos-Bot with Psybeam Focus, choking its core.

But then…

Gardevoir arrived, breathless but composed, still dressed in her stylish police uniform from the Fairy event, complete with a sharp pencil skirt and commanding heels.

In her hand: the Arceus Elixir, gifted by Hoopa after sensing trouble.

She gazed at Zapdos-Bot, analyzing its unstable core.

“Explosion radius: city-scale… No time.”

With solemn eyes, she sipped the Elixir, becoming Hourai-Immortal.

“I’ll contain it.”

She summoned a black hole within her, pulling the entire bot into herself.
It exploded inside her soul.

Blood gushed. Her body shook and cracked, then healed. Over and over.

Eve dropped her psychic grip, stunned by the sight.

“It’s okay,” Gardevoir whispered, forcing a faint smile. “It’s sad... but I’ll live. Even if Lucario won’t forever.”

Now immortal. Now burdened. Still in her sharp police uniform.
Two of six chosen remain…

-

Aftermath

Electabuzz tried to flee, but Miraidon and Jolteon tackled him outside the manor.

“You’re under arrest for blueprint theft and falling for the dumbest scam call in history,” Jolteon growled.

From far away, Regieleki stirred, finally sensing the electromagnetic wave that revealed the rough location of Poketopia.

It would still take time…
But the Regi Six had begun to move.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Chapter 15 : Keldeo saved by 8 Elements

[Keldeo’s Reckless Moment – Lil Eve Intervenes]

Lil Eve and Keldeo had been friends for a while now. Both teenagers, they shared gentle hearts, love for singing, and the kind of awkward charm that made them both endearing and just a little clumsy. While Eve often grinned sweetly and hesitated around stoic types at first, she always warmed up once she understood their heart. Keldeo was much the same, soft on the inside, brave on impulse.

But one day, Keldeo made a mistake.

He picked a fight with an Electrode, a rogue one under Electrabuzz's shady influence. Electrode retaliated instantly, zapping Keldeo and holding him hostage in a field of live static.

Out of nowhere, a lightning streak flashed into the scene, Lil Eve, surging in with Electro Drift, her fur crackling with Jolteon’s colors. With no time to think, she swiftly switched to Dazzling Gleam, blinding Electrode with a radiant burst of fairy light.

“Let go of him!” she shouted, flipping forward and igniting Flamethrower Trail.

The flames pushed Electrode back, but the slippery ball darted into the nearby waters to escape.

Recklessly, Keldeo dove in after him.

“Keldeo, wait, !” Eve shouted, diving in as well.

She activated Surf Waterfall, riding the cascading water like a tide champion. With Grassy Vines, she tried to ensnare Electrode, but it was already preparing to explode.

“For Electabuzz bro,” Electrode cried out, “we serve him, to bomb like creepers!!”

Eve gasped and unleashed Pulsive Foul Play, redirecting the attack and punting Electrode into the sky. Moments later, it exploded mid-air, the blast no bigger than a beach ball, but still dangerous.

Keldeo, bruised and struggling to get up from a slick riverside bridge, whimpered in pain.

Eve skidded to a stop, then quickly summoned Frost Print, creating a makeshift ice staircase up the bank. Though slippery, it was effective. She guided him up carefully, using Psybeam Focus to gently stabilize his limbs, healing without harm.

-

[Elsewhere – The Watcher]

From afar, on a high perch surrounded by frost, Articuno watched everything unfold. She was horrified.

Even as a self-proclaimed villain, she had standards.

“Using Electrode as walking bombs... to disgrace my fallen brother Zapdos?”

Her eyes narrowed. Even evil had a line.

-

[Gardevoir’s Black Hole Prison – A Lesson in Silence]

Electrabuzz, now stripped of all schemes, sat trapped in Gardevoir’s Black Hole Prison, a timeless space from which there was no escape. Now that Gardevoir is Hourai-immortal, not even death wishes or energy overloads could touch her.

“Please... I’ve changed...” Electrabuzz whispered, over and over. “I want redemption...”

He was visited by two unexpected guests:

- Cramorant, now a famed city fisherman, slurping up a fresh Vesula fish he’d caught that morning.

- Buzzwole, now the silent and ever-jacked bodyguard of Urshifu’s manor.

“Any advice?” Electrabuzz pleaded.

Cramorant just stared, swallowed his fish loudly, then burped.
Buzzwole didn’t say a word. He just flexed once.

Electrabuzz sighed.

“Great. Just great.”

-

[Meanwhile – Teenage Heartbeats]

Back in a quiet meadow, Lil Eve and Keldeo sat under the warm dusk sky, resting after the chaos. They leaned against each other, eyes closed, breathing in sync.

In the distance, Galarian Rapidash and Gastrier watched their son from a hill, while Vaporeon and Flareon observed their daughter with quiet joy.

The two teens cuddled gently. Not lovers, not yet. But something real was there. Something growing.

“They look... close,” Rapidash whispered.

“Too soon to say,” Flareon replied with a knowing smile, “but maybe not too far off.”

And under the fading light, the bond between Lil Eve and Keldeo shimmered, gentle, unsure, but genuine.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Chapter 16 : From Trolls to Game Streamers

[Scene – NaclCraft Streaming Hub]

Crustle, now a popular NaclCraft streamer, a long-running sandbox hit developed by Garganacl that’s been a top-seller for over ten years, is seen chatting live with Garganacl himself. The two laugh as Crustle recounts his harmless but hilarious trolling antics: wall traps during building contests, maze event dead ends, and cleverly placed salt blocks.

“They never saw the salt spike coming,” Crustle chuckled.
“Ten seconds in, and poof! Trapped!”

Garganacl boomed a low laugh in response.

“I told you that map was too spicy!”

Nearby, Greedent, another rising streamer, joins in the banter.

“I still remember getting baited into a loot room with nothing but salt... You two are evil!”

Laughter erupts again.

At the next table, Gengar and Sableye, well-known streamers of the long-running Mystic Vales Chronicles: Spirit of Galar, listen in. Though their main focus is the ghostly Galarian RPG, they often pop into NaclCraft to stir chaos for fun and to gather inspiration for Galarian Rapidash’s seasonal game events, which, incredibly, have been running strong for 14 years.

“SaltCraft’s still the best sandbox stress-reliever,” Gengar snickered.
“Nothing like trapping a Crustle in his own wall maze.”
“And stealing his loot,” Sableye added with a toothy grin.

-

[Scene – Galarian Rapidash Approaches]

Galarian Rapidash trots in gracefully, overhearing the laughs.

Beside her, Mudsdale, one of her loyal harem herd members, gives a knowing nod.

“I was the one who told Crustle and Greedent to try streaming NaclCraft,” Mudsdale said.
“They tried to troll me in-game... didn’t go well for them.”

“She out-tanked the salt trap,” Crustle groaned playfully.
“We surrendered immediately.”

Keldeo, strolling nearby, overhears the conversation and chimes in.

“My mom’s game and NaclCraft kinda complement each other... You share event ideas, right?”

Rapidash nodded, but with a hint of seriousness in her tone.

“Yes, but my events focus on peace, exploration, and personal growth.
Troll segments only happen under Gengar and Sableye’s watch. Let NaclCraft be the containment zone for salt and silliness.”

Just then, Keldeo nearly bumps into Lil Eve, who was shyly approaching with a bundle of fresh carrots as a gift for Keldeo and his family. Their noses nearly touch, and both teens freeze, blushing.

“O-oh! Uh, carrots! For... your mom!” Lil Eve stammered.

“Y-yeah! Thanks!” Keldeo said, trying to act cool while his tail flicked nervously.

-

[Scene – Unease in the Air]

A few steps away, Zebstrika, another member of Rapidash’s mare harem, lowers her head to sniff the ground.

“Electric traces,” she said, her mane flickering.
“Faint... but clearly from Electrodes.”

She narrowed her eyes.

“It’s not local. They’re signaling somewhere far beyond this region.”

Behind her, Metagross’s eyes glowed faintly. He had already sensed it.

“...I feel it too,” he murmured. “Something’s moving in the network. Not just mischief this time.”

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Chapter 17 : Regi-Bait Plans Pt 1

[Scene – Council of Guardians, Delphox’s Observatory]

After Metagross and Zebstrika report the strange and escalating electric signals to Delphox, she quietly processes the data through her magical flame.

“This isn't just noise,” Delphox murmured. “It’s a signal, a beckoning for chaos. If left alone, it’ll tear through Poketopia... but if redirected...”

Her eyes flare with sudden realization.

“Yes... someone chaotic enough to welcome it.”

-

[Cut to – Ruins of Wyrmhold]

Far away from Poketopia, nestled in frozen, arcane ruins, Froslass sits bored atop her icy domain, guardian of the forgotten Storage Catacombs, and an anti-hero craving mischief and challenge. The perfect vessel for chaotic interference.

Hoopa appears before her with a dramatic flourish, dragging a reluctant and guilt-ridden Electrabuzz (soon to begin community service).

“Hey Froslass,” Hoopa grinned. “How do you feel about fighting electric ghosts in the shape of ancient titans?”

Froslass chuckles, her eyes lighting up like frostfire.

“About time something fun showed up. Let me get my knives.”

-


[Scene – Delphox’s Plan]

Delphox continues briefing the others.

“To bait and distract the Regi Six, we’ll need four of the immortal elixir holders, Gardevoir, Alolan Ninetales, and two others, present near Froslass’s domain. Their ageless presence will draw attention.”

“Additionally, someone capable of stabilizing extreme temperatures... ideally with mastery over both Water and Fire.”

Silence falls until Greninja begins to speak, but finds no words. Vaporeon steps forward calmly, with Flareon and Lil Eve at her side.

“We’ll go,” Vaporeon says.
“Even if it means leaving our mortality behind.”

“It’s time,” Flareon adds softly.
“We’ve protected Poketopia long enough to accept what must come.”

Hoopa, stunned, lowers his gaze but respects their resolve. Then, Keldeo speaks.

“If they're going... I want to help too.”

His mother, Galarian Rapidash, trots in gracefully, placing her horned head against his.

“Brave as always, my son. I’ll go with you.”

Mewtwo and Mew appear from above, nodding solemnly.

“We’ll join,” Mewtwo says.
“They’ll need more than brute force, Regigigas is no fool.”

Suicune and even the ancient Ho-Oh volunteer as backup in case things go south.

-

[Scene – Tactical Planning Begins]

Delphox looks into the flame again.

“Distance of the Regi Six... 1.8 weeks. But they’re arrogant and easily caught off guard by unusual setups. Especially romantic ones.”

She flips open a scroll labeled ‘Plan: Date Trap.’

“Couples pretending to be on dates, ideal ambush bait. Romantic outfits recommended. Teens should wear school uniforms… for disguise and... plausible deniability.”

-

[Scene – Passing Warriors Take Notice]

Lucario and Mamoswine overhear talk of their immortal wives preparing for something huge. Across the plaza, Tyranitar (wearing unnecessarily massive heavy armor) and Tinkaton are passing by with their children, Pupitar and Tinkatink.

“Should we do something?” Tyranitar rumbles.
“Let’s ask Machamp to increase security,” Tinkaton replies, her hammer already crackling.
“But we stay on standby. When the call comes, we will strike.”

Lucario and Mamoswine nod in agreement.

-

[Scene – Assignment Briefings: Regi Six Ambush Plan]

- Regidrago: Easily countered by Galarian Rapidash and Tinkaton. Weak to fairy and hammer tactics.

- Regieleki: Can be buried by Tyranitar and Mamoswine, especially after luring it in with fake couple antics. It enjoys embarrassing couples, making it the most susceptible to the Date Trap.

[Vaporeon & Flareon, followed by Keldeo & Lil Eve, will serve as the lure.]

- Regice: Once the Date Trap succeeds, Flareon will engage with intense heat to melt its guard.

- Regirock: Can be baited next, Vaporeon will handle it with fluid, precise strikes.

- Registeel: Assigned to Lucario and Mamoswine, combining aura and ground force.

- Regigigas: The most dangerous. Unpredictable. Wears a mind blocker artifact, making telepathy useless. But with Keldeo and Lucario’s fighting skill, Tyranitar’s sand traps, and Mewtwo’s raw force, they may hold it off long enough for the rest to finish their tasks.

-

Delphox looks around at the gathered heroes and guardians.

“You have 1.8 weeks. Prepare your disguises, master your roles... and remember: this battle will begin with love, and end with legend.”

Chapter 18 : Regi-Bait Plans Pt 2

Three days into preparation…

Outside Eldegoss’ boutique, Dragonite, now a lead programmer thanks to a promotion after working on WarioWare, is seen speaking with Flygon. With Tyranitar scheduled to head into the Ruins of Wyrmhold to face the Regi Six, Dragonite asks Flygon to stand guard and monitor the area for any emerging threats.

Nearby, Amoonguss lounges on a bench, fully immersed in his handheld console. He's playing NaclCraft on the chaotic “Fungus Amogi” map, styled after Among Us. Just as he gets ejected as the Impostor, he groans in mock frustration. Dragonite chuckles and reassures him, “Space ejects are temporary, you’ll be back in orbit soon.”

Almost on cue, Garganacl joins the voice chat, teasing him through the headset alongside Crustle and Greedent, who are also in the game. Amoonguss bursts out laughing, happily rolling with the troll energy.

-

Inside the boutique…

Eldegoss is busy putting the final touches on specialized combat outfits:

- For Vaporeon, a water-resistant maid-style uniform with a combat-optimized pleated skirt, enhancing agility in aquatic terrain.

- For Flareon, a heat-resistant butler suit with durable long pants and a tuxedo-style bow, designed to support powerful fire-imbued kicks.

These serve as both their “date” uniforms and functional battlewear.

Their daughter, Lil Eve, has received a seifuku (school uniform) tailored for flexibility and mobility, its blue pleated skirt adapted for both aesthetic and combat utility.

Keldeo, meanwhile, sports a black gakuran, its long pants made to support swift and powerful kicks, simple, practical, and fitting for a teenage hero in the making.

[They are now getting ready...]

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Author's Notes:

Lil Eve’s progression, gaining eight elemental abilities, isn’t about brute force or boss gauntlets. While it draws inspiration from Mega Man’s system of defeating bosses to earn new powers and Pokémon’s classic 8-gym structure, her journey is more thematic than mechanical. This isn’t a game. There are no health bars, no attack cycles. Each ability she gains represents a lesson, an aspect of life, of nature, or of herself. They’re tied to growth, not conquest.

And while an actual Eevee-themed Mega Man-style fangame might be impossible, the spirit of that crossover lives in her. Lil Eve evolves not by evolution stone, but by experience, emotion, and insight.

Lil Eve Abilities:
1. Grassy Vines - A living tether she could now control like a grappling hook in warm, balanced environments.
2. Surf Waterfall - She could now generate clean surges of water to cross rivers, ascend streams.
passive: Cool her body in moments of stress. Infinite water breathing.
3. Flamethrower Trail - Leaving blazing paths behind her, capable of melting ice, searing grass, and igniting new possibilities. The flames burned brighter when fueled by spicy food.
passive: Heat-resistant. But cannot swim during activation.
4. Frost Print - The power to conjure and 3D-print icicle sculptures for tools, weapons, or art.
passive: Cold and slip resistance.
5. Dazzling Gleam - Emits radiant light in dark zones, capable of stunning or blinding opponents.
6. Pulsive Foul Play - A slap infused with mind-numbing force, scaling with the opponent’s own strength.
7. Psybeam Focus - Can fire a precise mental beam. Can levitate and manipulate objects. Can create minor localized tremors
8. Electro Drift - Dash at lightning speed. Electrify objects and surroundings.
passive: Gain temporary resistance to Electric damage.

Chapter 19 : Regi Raid Battle Pt 1

[Battle Day, 13 Days After the Plan, 10 Days After the Outfits Were Made]

At the heart of the Ruins of Wyrmhold, the four remaining Arceus Elixirs stand glowing at the beacon core, guarded by Alolan Ninetales and Gardevoir. As Hourai-immortals, they understand the catch: if they reconsume the Elixir, the elixirs and themselves merely rematerialize outside the ruins, immortality with a respawn clause.

Above the chaos, Flostlass watches with gleeful anticipation. The fight she’d yearned for was finally unfolding.

Far from the entrance, Regigigas looms, too massive to advance unnoticed. He commands his five minions, Regice, Registeel, Regirock, Regieleki, and Regidraco, to scout the ruins.

But Regidraco and Regieleki, too impulsive to wait, rush in ahead.

-

They arrive at a bizarre sight:
Vaporeon, in a sleek water-resistant combat maid uniform, is bridal-carrying Flareon, dressed in his fire-proof butler suit.
Beside them, Keldeo, in his black gakuran, awkwardly stares at Lil Eve, who’s wearing a seifuku modified for battle. With visible nerves, Keldeo tries (and fails) to bipedally bridal-carry Lil Eve. Lil Eve tries to return the gesture, but her shyness renders the lift barely successful.

Regidraco cringes audibly.
Regieleki, amused, whips out a camera to snap the bizarre date-scene…

-

Just then, 
Tinkaton, riding Galarian Rapidash like a valkyrie, crashes down with a radiant Dazzling Gleam + Gigaton Hammer combo on Regidraco, obliterating him mid-cringe.
Regieleki, too distracted, gets caught in a sudden Earthquake from Mamoswine, and is then slammed into a Sand Tomb by Tyranitar.

As the dust rises, Type: Null appears. Without hesitation, he finishes off the stunned titans, permanently killing Regidraco and Regieleki, their blood staining the stone.
Type: Null turns to Tyranitar and bows.

“An honor to finally meet the Rayquaza-Slayer himself.”

Regice, Regirock, and Registeel arrive to find their comrades dead.
Regirock suggests ambushing the couples, while Registeel targets Tyranitar and Type: Null directly.

The ambush begins.
Regice approaches stealthily, but Flareon intercepts with a fiery Flare Blitz, leaping from Vaporeon’s arms.
Regirock tries the same, but is blasted back by a powerful Surf from Vaporeon.

Vaporeon calls out to the younger fighters:

“Lil Eve! Keldeo! Get inside, prepare to face Regigigas!”

Without hesitation, they dash into the ruins.

-

Meanwhile, Registeel attempts to stab Tyranitar from behind, only to be rocked by another Earthquake from Mamoswine, followed by a gut-punch from Lucario.
Type: Null moves in to execute, but Registeel stomps the ground, sending a signal beacon to Regigigas.

Before Registeel can do more, Tyranitar crushes him with a brutal finishing blow, destroying the steel titan for good.

In the extended melee:

- Flareon finishes off Regice with a roaring Fire Blast.

- Vaporeon extinguishes Regirock with a searing Water Pulse.

Type: Null and Tyranitar land the final blows, ensuring both Regice and Regirock meet a permanent end.

Galarian Rapidash and Tinkaton return from patrol, stunned by the brutality.

“They’re… terrifying,” Rapidash murmurs.
Tinkaton nods, half-joking, half-serious. “My husband doesn’t mess around when he’s mad…”

The earth trembles, 
Regigigas has received Registeel’s signal. He’s on the move.

[To be continued…]

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Chapter 20 : Regi Raid Battle Pt 2

[...continuation]

Regigigas lets out a deafening roar, a sonic wave that reverberates through the entire ruin. The shockwave paralyzes several defenders and knocks Type: Null unconscious on impact. Without hesitation, Tinkaton and Galarian Rapidash drag his limp body deeper into the ruins, away from the frontline.

At the entrance chamber, Keldeo and Lil Eve brace for battle. But Regigigas is already on the move, he charges forward and slams into Lucario and Tyranitar, forcing them back step by step into the frigid threshold of the temple.

Sensing the tide shift, Keldeo and Lil Eve leap in to switch places with Lucario and Tyranitar.
Lil Eve cycles her elemental skills, Surf, Waterfall, and Flamethrower Trail, to maintain a precarious thermal balance, her breaths already fogging from strain.

Suddenly, Mewtwo descends from above in Mega Y form, firing a precise Psystrike to pull Regigigas’ attention. A moment later, Mewtwo switches to Mega X, landing in front of Regigigas with a grin, clearly enjoying himself as he engages the colossal titan in direct combat.

But Regigigas remembers something: a vulnerability within the ruins.
He turns and lumbers toward a hidden set of temperature stabilizer switches buried deeper inside the structure.

Mew, confused and alarmed, attempts to intercept him.

“What’s he doing? That’s not the core, ”

Before Mew can react, Regigigas grabs her. Mewtwo retaliates with a flurry of psychic strikes and punches, trying to free Mew.

Regigigas, unfazed, slams Mewtwo into the stabilizer switch controls.
The moment Mew slips from his grip, Mewtwo teleports them both to safety, but it’s already too late.

The stabilizers are sabotaged.

-

Alarms ring across the ancient halls.
The temperature spirals out of control. On one end, the heat side erupts in violent ice spikes, freezing anything in range. On the other, the cool side bursts into waves of fire and electricity.

Back at the entrance, the unstable temperature begins to sap the strength of Lil Eve and Keldeo. Regigigas slams the ground, sending massive stones down on top of them, crushing them under the weight.
Tyranitar and Lucario rush in to pull them free, but are slammed aside, their bodies bruised and bloodied by both Regigigas and the fluctuating heat.

Mamoswine attempts to assist, but is also hurled away with terrifying force.
Regigigas begins ascending the staircase toward the beacon room, where the Arceus Elixirs reside.

But then, Hoopa appears in Unbound Form, warping in with Ho-Oh and Suicune beside him.
Regigigas, unfazed, seals off the staircase exit, trapping them below.

Suicune channels her aura to stabilize the surrounding temperature field just enough for Ho-Oh to begin revival preparation.
But with Ho-Oh vulnerable, both Suicune and Hoopa Unbound are forced to take up defensive positions against the approaching titan.

At the beacon room, Alolan Ninetales and Gardevoir watch the chaos unfold on the monitors. The stabilizers are collapsing, and their powers, ice and psychic, are failing to correct the imbalance.

Even Froslass, observing nearby, shrugs.

“I could try... but not alone.”

Then, two Arceus Elixirs vanish.

They’re now in the hands of Vaporeon and Flareon, both still dressed in their tailored combat uniforms.
They step forward in unison, solemn but determined.

Vaporeon: “To keep this place stable, we need to stay alive… always.”
Flareon: “Then let’s never die.”

Together, they toast the elixirs and drink, their bodies glowing with divine light.
They are now Hourai-immortals.

-

Immediately, they split roles:

- Flareon runs into the furnace zone, enduring relentless ice spikes while restoring warmth with his fire kicks.

- Vaporeon dives into the icy zone, tanking lightning and searing bursts as she controls the flow with endless surfs.

After a brutal stretch of pain and elemental punishment, the temperature finally stabilizes.

-

Down below, Ho-Oh’s glow brightens.

With a mighty cry, he releases one final revival, bringing back the five fallen heroes:

- Lil Eve

- Keldeo

- Tyranitar

- Lucario

- Mamoswine

All bloodied, but alive once more.

[To be continued...]

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Chapter 21 : Regi Raid Battle Pt 3

[...continuation]

Ho-Oh, after using the last of his power to revive the five fallen heroes, collapses, his life flickering. The battlefield falls silent. Tears well up in everyone's eyes.

Tyranitar, with a fierce growl, breaks the silence. “No time to mourn yet! We end this now!”
He smashes through the rock barrier blocking the stairway.
“Lil Eve, Keldeo, follow me!”

They rush forward. Hoopa, reverting from his Unbound form to his base self, quietly hands each of them an Emergency Sitrus Berry. The two nod and sprint after Tyranitar (which Tyranitar eventually got surpassed by the teens' speed), fully healed.

-

[Beacon Room]

Regigigas has reached the beacon chamber, only to be pranked by a sudden ice blast from Froslass, who giggles playfully. “Been a while since I had fun like this.”

Regigigas roars in rage. “Where are the Elixirs?!”

Froslass sneers. “All your friends are dead, and you're too late.”

Regigigas stands frozen, until fury overtakes him and he charges. But Alolan Ninetales, an immortal, erects a massive ice wall to halt him. Gardevoir blasts him with Moonblast and then summons a black hole meant to end it all.

To everyone’s shock, Regigigas jams anti-psychic earplugs into place, resisting her attack. Gardevoir is stunned, and in that moment, Regigigas hurls her out of the ruins.

Ninetales steps forward. “I am the strongest now.”

Regigigas drives a massive stab through her chest, only to realize she doesn’t fall. Her immortality makes her unkillable. Enraged, he flings her after Gardevoir and tears through the chamber looking for the Elixirs.

-

[Outside the Beacon Chamber]

But the final two Arceus Elixirs are gone.

From above, Mewtwo (still in Mega X form) appears, floating midair with both vials in hand. Mew hovers beside him.

“You can't drink these,” Mewtwo says. “Legendaries like me, or Mythicals like Mew, would die.”

Regigigas lunges and slams Mew, grabbing one Elixir in triumph with evil laugh... 

...only to discover it’s a fake.

-

Behind him, Lil Eve appears, still in seifuku, now glowing. She’s already drunk the real one.

“You’ll never have this power,” she says, voice resolute.

Regigigas turns and spots Keldeo, still in gakuran, holding the final Elixir.

Lil Eve’s eyes tremble with emotion. “Don’t do it just for me...”

But Keldeo smiles. “I want to walk eternity with you.” He drinks.

Now immortal, he charges at Regigigas alongside Lil Eve.

-

[Final Battle Begins]

Regigigas roars in denial, pounded by elemental blows from Lil Eve, Grassy Vines, Surf Waterfall, Flamethrower Trail, Frost Print, Dazzling Gleam, Pulsive Foul Play, Psybeam Focus, Electro Drift. Meanwhile, Mewtwo barrages him with psychic fists.

Cracked, bruised, and bloodied, Regigigas is knocked down the stairs to the ruins’ entrance.

Mewtwo notices a single drop of Elixir on his hand, it whispers with Arceus’s voice: “Finish it.”

Mewtwo vanishes and reappears beside Regigigas.

But before he strikes, Type: Null, now recovered, lunges in to land the kill, only to be grabbed mid-air by Regigigas.

Tyranitar charges in after the anti-Regigigas' brawl's trails, snatching Type: Null to safety. 
“Hold on!”

Then Mewtwo punches.

One final, god-sent blow.

-

Regigigas doesn’t just die. 
He’s sealed into a Diavolo Death Loop, his soul trapped in a ghostly Arceus-shaped tablet, endlessly reliving his demise. 
The cruel justice is done.

Mewtwo smirks. “Good riddance.”

Tyranitar stares in horror. “That’s... brutal.”

Mewtwo picks up the tablet. “I’ll keep this for... rainy days.”

Mew, Lucario and Mamoswine arrive just in time to witness the endless deaths. Gardevoir and Ninetales return as well, watching silently.

-

[Aftermath]

The battle is over.

Vaporeon and Flareon, still in their immortal combat maid and butler outfits, rush out and find Ho-Oh in his final moments.

They kneel. Tears fall.

Hoopa, Lil Eve, Keldeo, Tinkaton, and Galarian Rapidash bow respectfully.

Flareon salutes. “o7.”

Ho-Oh smiles. “Regigigas is no more... Please take care of Suicune. She’s growing old, too. And this city must stop playing with deadly powers.”

He fades.

Mamoswine enters, holding the paw of his saddened wife, Ninetales. “I don’t have much time left either.”

Froslass approaches, silent at first. She then laughs hard at Regigigas’ fate, tears hidden behind the humor.

-

[Epilogue]

Hoopa receives a message from Delphox.

“The six who drank the Elixirs will feel less pain and be physically hardened. But immortality is a heavy crown. Good karma may reward them... but evil will find no mercy either.”

“Maybe, one day, someone from another dimension will arrive with a spaceship and take them to new adventures beyond the stars.”

“Ho-Oh’s passing... will be remembered.”

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Chapter 22 : Mortal Gods Immortal Heroes

Ho-Oh’s Futuristic Funeral – The Cremation

The sky was clear as Ho-Oh’s cremation began, ignited in solemn unity by Flareon, still clad in his eternal butler uniform, and Talonflame soaring beside him. As flames rose, tears fell.

Flareon turned to embrace his immortal wife, Vaporeon, forever in her maid uniform. Beside them, their daughter Lil Eve, the Eight-Elemental Eevee, still in her seifuku, cried softly, held by her now immortal boyfriend, Keldeo, who remained in his gakuran. Around them, Pokémon gathered, united in mourning.

Gardevoir, solemn in her policewoman pencil skirt and a dark mourning cloak, stood silently with Lucario, Machamp, Metagross, and Hatterene, who gently cradled an Iron Valiant figure without fear. Alolan Ninetales, cloaked in black over a blue pleated sundress, stood beside her husband, Mamoswine. Suicune wept the hardest, comforted by Lapras. Hoopa, Mew, and Mewtwo, who now held the Regigigas Death Loop tablet on mute, stood in respectful silence. Tyranitar, Tinkaton, and Galarian Rapidash (standing by her immortal son and daughter-in-law) watched quietly.

Dozens more gathered: Gastrier, Zebstrika, Mudsdale, Kantonian Rapidash, Spectrier, Charizard, Blastoise, Venusaur, Tsareena, Trevenant, serious Gengar and Sableye, Delphox, Greninja (clutching photos of fallen allies Cinderace and Decidueye), Zoroark, Absol, Alolan Raichu, Glaceon, Espeon, Umbreon, Leafeon, Sylveon, Jolteon, elderly Typhlosion, Kantonian Raichu (the once-revived Pikachu), Salazzle, Eldegoss, Chandelure, Comfey, Lilligant, Pheromosa, Buzzwole, Cramorant (now forgiven), elderly Blissey and Snorlax, Dragapult, Goodra, Duraludon, Garchomp, Urshifu, Zeraora, Sceptile, Flygon, Miraidon, Blaziken, Dragonite, Incineroar, Meowscarada, Inteleon, Wigglytuff, Zacian, Aegislash, Gyarados, Falinks, Dodrio, Scizor, Mimikyu, and Slowbro, who evolved into Slowking mid-ceremony. Psyduck, having finally dropped his Everstone, evolved into Golduck. A few of Duraludon’s robot maids moved among the crowd, offering refreshments with silent grace.

-

Private Moments of Comfort

Umbreon, one of the first Pokémon ever revived, stood beside Espeon as they comforted their now-immortal son, Flareon. Likewise, Glaceon and Leafeon embraced their immortal daughter, Vaporeon. The two couples then gently comforted their immortal granddaughter, Lil Eve, who was still teary-eyed. Galarian Rapidash laid her head gently on her son Keldeo’s shoulder, proud and sorrowful.

Kantonian Raichu, once the Pikachu frequently revived by Ho-Oh, stood quietly before the fire. “I no longer have my fail-safe,” he said. “It’s time I learn real humility.” He approached Urshifu, who nodded with understanding and shared wisdom on the mindfulness and self-awareness often lacking in those suffering from Main Character Syndrome.

-

Unexpected Guests and Redemption

Type: Null appeared quietly at the edge of the funeral, exchanging respectful nods with fellow bounty hunters Greninja, Zoroark, and Scizor. 

In the background, Articuno stood watch over Electabuzz, currently on community service. Electabuzz, subdued and shameful, whispered, “It’s all my fault.” Garganacl, overseeing the community work from his blocky manor, ordered Electabuzz to scrub the stone walls until they shined.

-

The Next Day: A Family Scene

The following morning, Flareon slipped into a swimming pool, stuck but not drowning. He flailed slightly, still unable to get out. Vaporeon sensed his distress through their immortal bond. In her maid uniform, she dove in, gracefully lifting Flareon bridal-style from the water. He clung to her, still in his butler uniform. They nuzzled, dripping but relieved.

From the porch, their daughter Lil Eve adjusted her seifuku while Keldeo straightened his gakuran. It was their first day of school, now eternal youths embarking on an infinite journey of learning.

Vaporeon smiled. “We may have endless time as a family, mother, father, daughter, and son-in-law, but let’s cherish the moments we share. Eventually, others will pass, and we must let them go with grace.”

Keldeo chuckled lightly. “Not even your game can last forever, Mom. Not NaclCraft. Not WarioWare. But that’s okay… we’ll enjoy them while we can.”

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Author's Notes:

This story takes place 13 years after the main events of the first 3 stories or trilogy, a timeskip into a futuristic setting where some characters have gained immortality, yet aging and death by natural causes still linger for others. The world has advanced, but mortality remains a quiet truth for many.

Not everyone escaped the cycle.

Ho-Oh, once a symbol of revival and divine intervention, is given a dignified farewell, a funeral not just of a legendary Pokémon, but of an era. In contrast, Regigigas, who defied the natural order by slaying Arceus, now suffers an ironic punishment: endless mortal deaths without true escape. He was denied peace, cursed with a loop of respawning and suffering, a mechanical eternity as hollow as it is relentless. It's poetic justice, cruel and fitting.

Immortality, in this universe, isn't always a gift. For those like Alolan Ninetales, Gardevoir, Flareon, Vaporeon, Lil Eve, and Keldeo, it's a chance to witness the passage of time and preserve memories. For others, like Regigigas, it becomes a prison.

The mourning Pokémon come together not just to honor Ho-Oh, but to reflect on the shifting meaning of life, legacy, and love in a world where some will outlive time, and others must face its end.

And look at Pikachu now.

Once the eternal mascot, the face of boundless energy and lighthearted chaos… now evolved into a Kantonian Raichu during the timeskip, finally accepting the Thunder Stone he had long avoided. For decades, he clung to that identity, perhaps out of comfort, legacy, or fear of change. But after Ho-Oh’s death, something clicked.

The one who revived him again and again was gone. There would be no more resets, no more divine second chances.

For the first time, Raichu felt the full weight of mortality, responsibility, and the need for inner growth. So he turned not to another battle, but to Urshifu, a master of discipline and humility. From a symbol of eternal youth to a seeker of wisdom, Raichu’s arc is one of quiet but profound evolution. No longer a mascot. Now a learner, a guardian, and perhaps, a philosopher in training.
