Opening Scene: 5 Years After the Bot Invasion

The snow whispered across the quiet mountain as Alolan Ninetales, dressed in a flowing white sundress with a pleated skirt, stood near the cliffside, enjoying a long-overdue vacation with her husband, Mamoswine. Beneath her paws, buried under decades of frost and debris, lay rusted remains of the fallen Dragobot—its jagged wreckage recently unearthed by a thawing avalanche.

Near the wreckage sat a small, half-frozen vial with an aged label scrawled in ancient ink:
“Arceus Elixir – Drink to become immortal.”

Ninetales tilted her head, squinting at the bottle. “Really? That’s it?” she scoffed, brushing snow from her dress. “Will I become the strongest?” she asked aloud, partly joking—then, with a shrug, downed the elixir in one smooth gulp.

Mere seconds later, Mamoswine attempted to climb the same slope behind her, but his massive body and age worked against him. He lost his footing and tumbled down the icy incline, crying out in pain. Ninetales dashed toward him instinctively—too recklessly.

She slipped on a patch of ice and was impaled through the chest by a massive shard of jagged dripstone jutting from the rocks below, barely saved Mamoswine.

Mamoswine’s eyes widened in horror. “NINETALES!”

But to his utter disbelief, she gasped, winced—and smiled. “Oopsies... you alright? I was such an idiot, sorry.” She giggled weakly. “Bakatales moment…”

He rushed to her side, gently pulling her from the spike. Her bloodstained dress shimmered—and within seconds, her body healed completely, the fabric restored as if untouched. It dawned on both of them: she couldn’t die. Not anymore. The elixir had worked. The immortality was real.

Moments later, a golden ring shimmered into existence as Hoopa arrived through a portal, drawn by the ancient energy that had just awakened.

“One of the six elixirs…” Hoopa muttered, examining the now-empty bottle. “These were meant to be sealed… reserved for only the most sacred emergencies.”

He stared at Ninetales, now brushing snow off her still-pristine dress. “It’s done. It can’t be undone. And Ho-Oh… he doesn’t have long left. Eight years, at most.”

-

Eight Years Later (13 Years After the Bot Invasion)

Time marched forward. Mamoswine’s thick coat was now peppered with gray, and his movements had slowed with age. But Alolan Ninetales remained unchanged—her sundress still fluttered gently in the breeze, her beauty untouched by time. Immortal. Unmoving. Unfading.

A gentle knock came at the door of their cozy mountain home.

“Coming!” she called, and opened it to a familiar trio.

“Hey Auntie Tails!” said Lil Eve cheerfully—a teenage Eevee with her mother’s grace and her father’s goofy smile. Behind her stood Vaporeon, now a seasoned lifeguard and part-time aquatic forager, and Flareon, wearing a smart apron and carrying a bag of baked goods, now a full-time chef and part-time blacksmith.

“We brought snowberry pies!” Flareon beamed.

Vaporeon smiled warmly. “And some gifts for your little ones—Piloswine and Alolan Vulpix, right?”

Ninetales chuckled. “They’ll love it. Thank you, both of you.”

Lil Eve tilted her head. “You still look the same, Auntie Tails… even prettier, I think!”

Ninetales forced a laugh, brushing a strand of hair behind her ear. “Thanks, sweetie. Must be the snow.”

Inside, a subtle silence lingered beneath the surface cheer. Vaporeon glanced at her with knowing eyes. Immortality, after all, wasn’t as gentle as the snow made it seem.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


Scene: A New Era of Peace

The city skyline shimmered beneath a clean sky, where aerial transport glided past solar towers and floating gardens. Human-shaped AI robots—sleek, expressive, and warm in tone—roamed the streets assisting citizens and Pokémon alike. 

They were all products of Duraludon’s genius, now a renowned AI and robotics engineer whose lab stood tall with neon runes tracing its steel limbs like veins of light. 

For thirteen long, peaceful years, the city had known safety, innovation, and harmony.

Families thrived. Vaporeon and Flareon walked side by side, their daughter Lil Eve now a bright, inquisitive teenager learning both survival and kindness. The dark days of the bot invasion were now historical archive footage, a lesson and a scar.

-

Scene Shift: Old Gravestones Beneath a Crimson Sunset

Outside the city limits, past the now-defunct battlefield turned into a lush meadow, stood two modest gravestones. One was engraved with a resolute bow and the other a scorched boot: Decidueye and Cinderace, fallen fourteen years ago. Wildflowers had grown around the stones, undisturbed except for one lone visitor.

A shimmering ring swirled open—Hoopa stepped out, solemn for once.

He hovered there in silence, hands folded behind his back, eyes narrowed not in mischief, but memory.

"Fourteen years." he muttered. “Still feels fresh…”

Then, he turned his gaze northeast, where the snowy mountains crowned the horizon. His golden eyes softened with weary respect.

“She figured it out instinctively... that Ninetales. Immortality was never meant for mortals,” he said to no one, “and yet she wears it with grace. A foolish drink. A foolish move. But…”

A faint chuckle escaped his lips, melancholic and wise.

“She saved him. And now he lives longer than he ever would’ve… That dress of hers—heh, not even a scratch on it.”

He looked back at the gravestones.

“…And we, the so-called gods, we can’t touch the Arceus Elixir. Not even sip it. The irony…” His voice tightened. “A drop and we die. No revival. Not even Ho-Oh.”

The wind blew gently, scattering dandelion seeds past his face as if nature itself tried to offer comfort. Hoopa closed the ring and vanished, leaving behind nothing but a ring-shaped impression in the grass and two eternally resting heroes.


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


[Flashback – 100 Years Ago | The Cosmic Plane]

Shimmering above the mortal realm, on a tranquil, starlit rift of space known only to the divine, Arceus floated in gentle contemplation. The Creator’s presence pulsed like a heartbeat across the firmament. Standing before him were Mew, her form small yet ancient, and her son Mewtwo, composed but curious. Hoopa hovered near the cosmic portal he had summoned, watching vigilantly.

Arceus looked to Mew with a rare glint of serenity.
“We exist to guide, not to dominate. Immortality… is not infinite if forgotten.”

Mew nodded solemnly. “And yet, your existence gives this plane structure. We are pieces of the same pattern.”

Suddenly—BOOM.

A rupture tore through the plane. A swirling black hole of artificial origin exploded into the realm. Mewtwo was flung into Hoopa’s portal, vanishing unconscious. Hoopa was knocked back, and the celestial plane shook.

Regigigas emerged, draped in brutal tech and clad in malice.
Behind him came Regice, Registeel, and Regirock—each enhanced with armor etched in forbidden glyphs. Soon after, Regieleki and Regidrago encircled Hoopa, cutting off escape.

“Immortality… is wasted on gods with rules,” Regigigas growled. “I will take it… for us.”

Arceus charged, light radiating in a holy pulse. Mew darted to his defense—
—but was surrounded and bound by the three Regi titans.

Hoopa’s rings cracked as he entered Unbound Form, lashing portals and energy in a desperate defense, barely holding his ground.

But then—the needle.
Forged in shadows, built to pierce the divine.

Regigigas drove it deep into Arceus’ chest.

Time froze.

The Creator cried out—not in pain, but finality. As his form unraveled into radiant dust, six luminous vials materialized from his vanishing core—the Arceus Elixirs.
Each one glowed with life eternal… and a curse.

Mew broke free in anguish and, with Hoopa’s help, unleashed a vortex sealed in an ancient void. The six Regi monsters were sucked in, screaming, sealed beneath the world in a dimensionless prison.

As the rift began to close, a faint ghostly echo of Arceus appeared, whispering to Mew and Hoopa:

“The Elixirs… grant what I once bore…
But beware… they do not heal… they do not forgive…
They are not for gods. They are not for the weak.
Only those who choose the burden… shall survive eternity.”

Mewtwo reappeared, breathless, watching his fallen origin vanish into nothing. He said nothing. No one did.

Hoopa sealed the Elixirs away, high in the frozen mountains, far from legend and light.

-

[Present Day – Earth’s Crust Beneath the North]

A thunderous quake. The old void ruptures.

Six titanic figures step out.

Cracked armor. Red eyes. Ancient fury.
The Regi Six... had returned.

Regigigas cracked its joints and raised its arms high.

“Free... at last. The world has forgotten.
But we will remind it.
Immortality… will make us gods.”

He laughed. Madly. Deeply. Without fear.

“With no death, there is no consequence. And with no consequence—there is no law.”


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


[Present Day – Poketopia City | Psychic Chapter Begins]

Though danger brewed silently on the opposite side of the world, Poketopia City basked in sunshine and technological serenity. Elevated rail pods zipped between gleaming towers. Holograms danced in the air. Robots—both utilitarian and aesthetic—walked among Pokémon and humans alike in perfect sync.

Mew, floating with casual grace, scrolled through the PokéNet on her sleek touchscreen pad. She smiled.

“Five stars. Espeon’s Library… this place has evolved well.”

She glanced at Mewtwo, who stood beside her in silent observation. Cloaked, his expression was unreadable—but he gave a silent nod. He’d saved many cities under Mew’s quiet requests, often anonymously. This time felt more… personal.

With a ripple of space, Hoopa emerged beside them and opened a swirling ring.

“Your portal to Poketopia awaits! Try not to destroy anything this time, Mewtwo.”

Mew giggled. Mewtwo merely exhaled through his nose.

They arrived.

The city was even more dazzling in person. Neon gardens climbed up smart-glass skyscrapers. Drone-winged Pidgeots soared with style. Beneath all of it stood a majestic art-deco style building—Espeon’s Library.

They stepped inside.

“Welcome,” said Espeon, her violet eyes kind and piercing all at once. Though she now looked like a 40-something grandmother, her coat was still sleek, her expression sharp. “You’ve arrived just in time for quiet hour.”

Beside her, Duraludon, now a respected AI and robotic engineer, bowed slightly. His long, metal frame had subtle upgrades, and a technician’s monocle gleamed on his head fin.

Mew’s eyes twinkled as she floated through the high-vaulted hall.

“This is marvelous… robots working in harmony with knowledge.”

Duraludon’s robotic maid—sleek, humanoid, and wearing a bowtie—offered trays of herbal tea to everyone.

Mewtwo, on the other hand, walked directly up to Espeon and asked flatly:

“Do you have family?”

Espeon blinked, amused. “A granddaughter. She loves singing. You’ll hear her in the music wing sometimes.”

Hoopa hovered nearby, raising an eyebrow.

“She doesn’t look like a grandma.”

Mew laughed with delight. “No wrinkles, no cane, no creaks. I should borrow your skincare routine!”

Mewtwo chuckled—a rare sound.

“This city really is unhinged.”

As they explored, they passed Delphox, who had just closed a book titled Mind Beyond Matter: Advanced Psychic Type Mastery. She was older now, eyes serene, and had two children waiting at home. She offered a gentle nod to the group.

But as she passed by the DNA section, one of the nearby books lit up faintly red in her holo pocket crystal—a subtle flicker, barely noticed.

Curious, she joined the impromptu psychic circle forming at the corner lounge: Espeon, Mew, Mewtwo, and herself.

They began discussing psychic evolution, intergenerational memory, and how emotions affected mind-reading precision. It was peaceful. Civil. Illuminating.

Duraludon’s maid-bots poured more tea. Outside, the sky dimmed into evening. The city’s lights shimmered alive.

-

Far away… beneath the crust… the Regi Six stirred.


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

[Poketopia Library – Psychic Symposium, Present Day]

It was another vibrant day in Poketopia City. The air smelled like synth-flowers and steaming mochi from automated street stalls. Inside the chrome-and-crystal halls of Espeon’s Library, the psychic types gathered once more.

Gardevoir entered gracefully, giving a fond wave to her Kirlia daughter and Lucario, her husband, before joining the meeting.

From another side, Galarian Rapidash, glowing with mystic elegance, nuzzled her dark spectral husband Gastrier affectionately. He gave a brief whinny before cantering off to his herd—a harem composed of Spectrier, Mudsdale, Zebstrika, and Kantonian Rapidash. Their shared son, Keldeo, trailed behind his unicorn mother, enchanted by the library’s science and mythology section.

Delphox soon joined with her gifted psychic students. She had waved to Greninja and their Froakie son, who were off to swimming class, while their Braixen daughter simply came to spectate with a popsicle in hand.

At the round table, waiting with a mix of calm and caffeine, sat Espeon (librarian and curator), Mew, Mewtwo, and Hoopa.

| “Let’s begin,” Espeon purred, floating a clipboard made of psychic light.

But before the first topic was spoken, Mewtwo, ever the stoic instigator, suddenly gestured at the ancient holo-timer on the table.

| “Let’s peer through time. I want to see something... primal.”

Delphox’s crystal flickered as the time viewer swirled to life, and soon, the psychics beheld…

-

[1000 Years Ago – Ancient Poketopia Prehistoric Times]

Through the mists of time, they watched:

A hulking male Tyrantrum, wearing a caveman loincloth, thundered through a jungle, chasing a frightened female Aurorus in equally crude cave attire. Her crystals shimmered in fear—but she was clever.

She dashed toward a glade, where a noble being awaited: Koraidon, great-great-grandfather to today’s Miraidon. He knelt, presenting fish he had caught—a peace offering.

Aurorus took the fish gently. Though a vegan, she understood: this was survival. She returned and, with trembling hooves, offered them to the pursuing Tyrantrum.

Tyrantrum, breathing heavily, blinked.

| “You fed me? Not ran? Not fought? …Wife material.”

Aurorus blushed.

| “Feeding is love. Let’s build… something together.”

That moment, recorded by fate, sparked the founding of the very first stone shelter in what would one day become Poketopia—a line that would eventually birth Tyranitar.

Hoopa was stunned. “Did we just watch a censored dinosaur romcom?!”

Everyone was too shocked to speak.

-


[Fast-Forward: 69 Years Ago – The Scam Saga]

The timeline flickered again. This time they saw:

A younger Zapdos, feathered in gold-tinted business attire, hawking a shady immortality “potion” to Type: Null behind a dumpster made of old PC Boxes. Nearby, Rayquaza, suspiciously dressed like a shady guru, tried to upsell a “Dragon Coin” NFT scam.

Articuno, standing beside them in a sleek winter coat, rolled her eyes.

“Disgusting. I’d steal immortality through honest evil, not pyramid schemes.”

Null, however, had enough. He trapped Zapdos in a golden cube. But not before Zapdos activated his moon-sized bomb implant, sealing himself beneath what would become Tyranitar’s Manor.

Rayquaza, left behind, barely survived over the decades—scraping by from duping MLM hopefuls and installing the cursed Timi Timmy Co. logo into his chest.

The scars remained—literally. One shaped like a rocky claw… made him shiver.

-

[28 Years Ago – Darkrai’s Mistake]

Darkrai, still a heartbroken young adult from his Wigglytuff breakup, wandered past. Rayquaza pounced.

“Sign up for this crypto cult and get six stars! …Also immortality.”

Darkrai, vulnerable and debt-ridden, joined.

The rest was unhinged history.

-

[Back to Present – Poketopia Library]

The viewer powered down. Silence fell upon the psychics.

Mew turned to Hoopa. “That was… a lot.”

Hoopa nodded. “I need tea and possibly therapy.”

Mewtwo simply folded his arms.

“So that’s why Rayquaza keeps dying to Tyranitar.”

Gardevoir rubbed her temples. “And Zapdos is worse than we thought.”

Delphox sipped her tea. “I feel like I just read five separate soap operas crammed into one.”

Espeon sighed.

“This timeline is more cursed than I cataloged. But I can’t stop reading.”

Everyone nodded solemnly. Somewhere, Keldeo sneezed in the science wing.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


[Poketopia – The Eight Plates Ceremony]

The ancient vision had left the psychic types deep in thought. But there was little time to reflect. The threat of the Regi Six loomed, and the Arceus Elixirs still held dangerous mysteries.

Then, in the shimmering heart of the library, Hoopa appeared again—this time with a solemn expression and arms full of glowing artifacts.

“It’s time,” Hoopa said. “The Plates must return to the ones who still carry Arceus’ intent. Especially... to her.”

He floated the Psychic Plate toward Espeon, whose eyes widened.

Delphox, standing nearby, closed her book and whispered, “It’s her time. Your granddaughter, Lil Eve… she must inherit all eight elemental virtues. Only then will she be ready.”

Espeon trembled. “Lil Eve… is ready?”

Delphox nodded. “She’s the spark that bridges every path. The child of two elements, descended from hope and flame.”

-

[Over the Next Days – The Plates Are Passed On]

One by one, Hoopa visited the city's most trusted and legendary Eeveelutions—each of whom had touched Lil Eve’s life in some way:

- The Dark Plate was given to Doctor Umbreon, Espeon’s loyal husband, as he exited his shift at the nocturnal clinic.

- The Fire Plate was handed to Flareon, Lil Eve’s father, while he worked in the city’s geothermal greenhouse cooking there.

- The Water Plate went to Vaporeon, Lil Eve’s gentle mother, beside the tranquil memorial lake where Decidueye and Cinderace’s stones stood.

- The Ice Plate was delivered to Glaceon, Vaporeon’s wise mother, found meditating under frozen waterfalls in the Winter Gardens.

- The Grass Plate was given to Leafeon, her serene grandfather, tending to bonsai forests on floating tree platforms.

- The Electric Plate was entrusted to Officer Jolteon, her protective uncle figure, fresh off disabling a rogue vending bot.

- The Fairy Plate went to Sylveon, her elegant aunt figure and a schoolteacher known for nurturing young minds with poetry and song.

And at last, all eight gathered under one roof—the grand skylit Library of Poketopia.

Lil Eve stood at the center, glowing faintly with inner light, the Plates arranged around her like petals.

-

[The Ceremony – Words from Urshifu]

Stepping forward from the gathering crowd came Urshifu, a wanderer of myth, flanked by his friends Zeraora and Sceptile, both nodding in silent respect.

Urshifu addressed Lil Eve with a voice like thunder in rain:

“You stand on the path of life types—not just in name, but in soul. To master all eight is to understand the world beyond combat. Listen well…”

He raised his paw as each Plate shimmered.

- Grass: “Tests balance. Without harmony in temperature, nothing grows. You must learn when to yield and when to root.”

- Water: “Tests direction. Flow without panic. Swim not just with strength, but purpose.”

- Fire: “Tests temper. Fire creates, warms, comforts—when you will it, not when you lose it.”

- Ice: “Tests preservation. Calm yourself, even when everything slips away.”

- Fairy: “Tests the art of presence. Beauty, kindness, and charm—they shape how others feel your power.”

- Dark: “Tests justice. Not all that’s right is gentle. Learn to see through shadows, and strike without cruelty.”

- Psychic: “Tests wisdom. See the unseen. Solve the puzzle that is yourself.”

- Electric: “Tests speed and consequence. A surge gives life—or ends it. Control the charge within.”

Lil Eve, silent and steady, bowed. She understood. These were not just types—they were ways to live.

Urshifu smiled, placing his paw over her heart.

| “You are not your powers. You are what you do with them.”

With a nod to Espeon and Flareon, he turned. Zeraora and Sceptile were already waiting. As the three legends vanished into golden sparks, the library was left in reverent silence.

Lil Eve closed her eyes. The journey had begun.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


[Trial of Grass – The Gracious Balance]

In the steamy comfort of the old fountain house—built during her parents' university days—Lil Eve stretched her limbs and let the warm mist swirl around her. The memories of her family surrounded her in the architecture, the stone etchings, and the ivy crawling up the outer windows.

She tapped her holo pendant.

“Grandpa Leafeon? I want to start with Grass. I feel… ready.”

Moments later, her call was answered. Leafeon's calm, leaf-scented voice replied.

“Then let the roots of your journey begin.”

The next morning, Lil Eve arrived at the newly transformed garden arena. Tsareena, now married to Trevenant, had turned her once-private estate garden into a living classroom. Their children, a spry Steenee and a playful little Pumpkaboo, toddled between vines and flowerbeds.

A graceful yet vibrant assembly of Grass Pokémon gathered to witness and guide the trial:

- Leafeon, poised with wisdom in his tail flicks.

- Tsareena, regal and proud.

- Trevenant, standing rooted like a sage.

- Venusaur, blooming with authority.

- Roserade, elegantly attentive.

- Lilligant, accompanied by her curious Petilil daughters.

- Meowscarada, twirling her mask as her Sprigatito son purred beside her.

- Sceptile, arms crossed, eyes sharp as blades.

- Chesnaught, stoic and silent.

- Eldegoss, floating gently like pollen on a breeze.

At the center of the garden, a young berry tree sapling rested inside a decorative soil pot. Around it, nutrient beds had been tilled and prepared—awaiting Lil Eve’s decision.

Lil Eve held her book tight—Temperature and Photosynthesis: A Study of Growth.

Venusaur spoke first, rumbling in his baritone:

“Without fertilizer, your roots will be thirsty.”

Meowscarada chimed in with a sly smirk:

“You’ll want this done before the sunlight dips. Grass doesn’t wait for the moon.”

Sceptile cracked his neck.

“This is a trial of balance, not just action. Place it right, or it won't bloom.”

Trevenant nodded and stepped forward.

“I shall be your gauge. My bark feels heat and cold. Listen well—too hot, and it’ll wilt. Too cold, and it’ll sleep.”

Lil Eve moved slowly, shifting the berry tree pot across the garden with concentration. Each time, Trevenant murmured:

“Too cold.”
“Too hot.”
“Still too warm…”

It wasn’t until Eldegoss floated by and smiled, pointing with a gust of fluff, that Lil Eve noticed a perfect patch—dappled light, breezy shade, and slightly raised ground.

“Right here,” Lil Eve whispered.

She knelt, mixing the organic fertilizer gently into the soil, and watered the roots with steady care. Then, one by one, the Grass Pokémon stepped forward—channeling their power into the plant.

Leaves danced. Light shimmered. Petals bloomed.

The sapling exploded with life, shooting upward with vines, berries, and blossoms in seconds.

Leafeon approached and placed the Leaf Plate before her. It shimmered, then pulsed—and a small shard broke off into a Mini Leaf Stone, merging into Lil Eve’s chest like a heartbeat.

Green vines circled her arms and shoulders, becoming the Grassy Vines—a living tether she could now control like a grappling hook in warm, balanced environments.

Her coat shimmered green—mimicking her grandfather’s fur, leaf-tail and all. She blinked, and with focus, returned to her base Eevee form. Her eyes sparkled with potential.

“One down,” Leafeon said with a warm smile. “The wilds will no longer fear you. You’ve learned to grow, not just survive.”

The garden applauded in rustling leaves.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

[Trial of Water – The Test of Flow and Depth]

Later that evening, as the moon cast ripples of silver across the glassy windows, Lil Eve sat curled up in her towel robe, brushing her damp fur. The steam from the bath still clung faintly to her.

She turned to her mother, who was humming softly while drying her fins.

“Mom… I’m ready for the Water element. Can we do it tomorrow?”

Vaporeon blinked, then smiled gently.

“Of course, my dear. I’ll let someone special know.”

In the kitchen, Flareon stirred a sizzling pot of berry stew. He gave a thumbs-up with a ladle.

“I’ll make sure dinner helps you breathe underwater.”

The next morning, Greninja stood at the gates of his luxurious and eccentric aquatic complex—a training pool unlike any other. Its twisting canals and submerged chambers were built for stealth… and mystery. Hidden compartments, swirling currents, and oxygen bubble traps filled the watery maze.

Gathered in solemn purpose (and some excitement) were a lineup of veteran Water-types:

- Vaporeon, calm and maternal.

- Greninja, sleek and focused.

- Blastoise, arms crossed, water cannons gleaming.

- Gyarados, looming in his trench of currents.

- Slowbro, staring at nothing in particular.

- Psyduck, proudly unevolved and holding his head.

- Primarina, graceful as ever, humming notes that swayed the water.

- Azumarill, bouncing with energy beside her waterproof guitar.

- Inteleon, cool and smug, sipping from a glass.

- Swampert, flexing in silence with a grunt.

- Lapras, elegant and kind.

- Suicune, now elderly but dignified—her presence a safeguard.

“I’m here… to make sure no one sinks too far,” she said softly.

Lil Eve, now equipped with a custom aqua suit, breathing gear, and her newly awakened Grassy Vines, awaited her task.

Vaporeon stepped forward.

“This is not a battle of strength. This is a test of direction, rhythm… and breath. Deliver these items. One at a time. No shortcuts.”

She handed Eve a delivery bag. The test began.

-

Round One – Shallow Route

- A stainless ninja helmet for Greninja – smooth delivery, no issues.

- A fire extinguisher for Blastoise – amusing, but easy.

- A waterproof guitar for Azumarill – she squealed with joy and strummed a splashy tune.

Round Two – Moderate Currents

Here, the tunnels twisted tighter, and subtle whirlpools formed.

- A meal of Veluza fillet for Gyarados – Eve used her Grassy Vines to slingshot herself safely through.

- A precious pearl to Primarina – who accepted it with a song.

- A liquor bottle to Inteleon – he smirked and toasted her silently.

- A dumbbell to Swampert – he grunted approval.

Round Three – The True Test

Currents thickened. The water dimmed. Eve felt the pull of exhaustion creeping in.

- A memory card to Slowbro – who was so still, Eve nearly missed him.

- More Veluza meals to Psyduck – who panicked and nearly swam into a wall.

- A boat ticket for Lapras – in the deepest section, blocked by shifting tunnels.

Just as Lil Eve began to tire, struggling for breath, Suicune appeared and placed an air bubble gently over her.

“You’ve done enough. Let the current carry you up now.”

She rose slowly through the water, surfacing to gasps of fresh air and applause from above.

Vaporeon, waiting at the edge of the pool with trembling paws, rushed to her daughter and embraced her tightly.

“You did it! You really did it…!”

She handed Lil Eve the Water Plate. Like before, it pulsed—this time, glowing like moonlit waves. A Mini Water Stone broke off and merged into Lil Eve's chest.

Water swirled around her body—manifesting the Surf + Waterfall ability. She could now generate clean surges of water to cross rivers, ascend streams, and cool her body in moments of stress.

Her fur shimmered a translucent blue, echoing her mother’s sleek design. With a shimmer, she returned to Eevee form, giggling.

“That was amazing, Mom.”

Vaporeon, overwhelmed with pride, teared up—her emotions causing an unintended flood of salty water to pour into the pool.

“Mom, stop—Greninja’s yelling!”
Greninja was already hopping around in panic.
“That’s my water filtration system!!”

Everyone burst into laughter as Suicune sighed and summoned gentle winds to clean up the flood.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

[Trial of Fire – The Test of Temper and Creation]

That night, the steam of bathwater still trailing off their bodies, Lil Eve and her mother Vaporeon arrived home, both soaked but smiling. As they shook off the water at the doorstep, the rich scent of roasted berries and grilled Vesula meat drifted from the kitchen.

Flareon, tail ablaze and eyes focused, had just plated dinner.

“Dad,” Lil Eve said, stepping closer, “I think I’m ready for the Fire challenge next.”

He looked up, his grin wide and flame flickering brighter.

“You? Fired up already?”
“Fired up as ever.”
“Then I guess it’s time.”

He pulled out his communicator.

“Charizard, we’ve got a firestarter.”

-

The next morning, they arrived at the BlazeGrill Neo branch, a fire-type communal kitchen built beside a geothermal greenhouse—perfect for both cooking and forging.

A group of Fire-types, already crackling with energy, gathered for the occasion:

- Flareon, proud and puffed.

- Charizard, wings spread wide.

- Blaziken, intense as always.

- Delphox, calm and sharp-eyed.

- Incineroar, roaring with his little Litten daughter in tow.

- Chandelure, floating with eerie flames.

- Salazzle, lounging with a knowing smirk.

- Talonflame, soaring in circles above.

- Ho-Oh, radiant and regal despite his age, perched calmly in the background.

Lil Eve looked around nervously.

“So… I’m cooking?”

Flareon nodded.

“Today, fire is your forge. Your challenge is to use these tools—chef’s gear and blacksmith sets—to prepare dishes using berries, veggies, and Vesula meat. But mind the lava furnace. Fire creates… but it destroys just as fast.”

-

First Test – The Spice Gauntlet

Blaziken casually popped a blazing red chili into his beak. No sweat.

Talonflame and Charizard followed suit, flames sparking from their mouths. Even Ho-Oh did it, eyes shimmering with nostalgia.

Lil Eve stared at her own chili, eyes watering already.

“Dad… how?!”

Without hesitation, Flareon chomped his chili clean in half.

“It’s all about the burn... and the control.”

Gritting her teeth, Lil Eve did the same—then squealed and sprinted to the back kitchen. Her Surf Waterfall ability instinctively activated, dousing her mouth and creating a puddle that nearly extinguished Chandelure, who screeched and hovered away, dripping.

-

Second Test – The Flame of Focus

With the help of the kitchen forge, Lil Eve prepared orders under pressure:

- Blaziken requested spicy corn-berry fries – a success.

- Delphox and Chandelure wanted fruit & fish skewers, spiced.

 -- She nearly burned the fish, but saved it in time.

- Incineroar and Salazzle asked for charred Vesula cuts.

 -- The flames flared too high.

 -- She reflexively used Surf Waterfall, dousing the fire just before disaster.

“Pffft,” Incineroar chuckled, inspecting the half-burnt meat.
“You know, I did this every week back when I was learning. You’re doing great.”

Reassured, Lil Eve focused hard and nailed the remaining orders. Her final creation was a flaming spice soufflé for Ho-Oh—who took one bite and sighed in delight, feathers glowing warmly.

-

As the flames settled, Flareon stepped forward, eyes bright with pride.

“You passed. Fire’s not just heat. It’s temper, timing, and transformation.”

He held out the Fire Plate. It pulsed in her paws—then released a glowing Mini Fire Stone, which melted gently into her fur.

Flames danced along her back briefly, her coat shifting to match her father's burning hues. She felt her body grow heat-resistant, and her instincts unlock a new move:

Flamethrower Trail – leaving blazing paths behind her, capable of melting ice, searing grass, and igniting new possibilities. The flames burned brighter when fueled by spicy food.

She beamed.

“Wow… I feel like a walking bonfire!”

Suddenly—POOF!—she had accidentally dropped a raw Vesula steak too close to her trail. It turned to ashes.

“Oops.”

“And now you’ve learned the final fire lesson,” Flareon smirked.
“Don’t overdo it.”

Everyone laughed, even Chandelure—who still hovered a little farther away than usual.

[Trial of Ice – The Parkour of Madness and Scam Calls]

That evening, Vaporeon waited at home with extra water bottles stacked like a fortress, just in case. The door swung open to reveal Flareon carrying a soot-covered stew pot and Lil Eve, who coughed up a tiny puff of smoke, face red but triumphant.

“She can handle spicy now,” Flareon grinned.
“Mostly,” Eve wheezed.

Once hydrated, Lil Eve called her icy grandmother Glaceon through the holo-comm.

“Grandma, I want to try the Ice Element next.”

Glaceon’s frosty expression didn’t budge.

“Are you sure? Mine’s not a trial. It’s cold hell.”

“I’m sure.”

The Next Morning

They arrived at a massive sub-zero arena known as The Frozen Maw—a sprawling vertical dungeon made of icy platforms, rotating lifts, and bone-chilling wind tunnels. It was Alolan Ninetales' pet project, constructed using her Hourai-style immortality and zero concern for sanity.

“I call it Parkour of the Permafrost!” Ninetales said proudly.
“She fell off it 136 times while building it,” said her grumbling husband Mamoswine, who kindly installed anti-fall-damage cushions across the dungeon.
“I’m fine!” Ninetales shouted from halfway up the tower.
“She always survives,” added Lapras, unimpressed.
Weavile, watching nearby, shrugged. “She’s not wrong.”

Also present were:

- Glaceon, observing coolly.

- Alolan Ninetales, clearly too into this.

- Mamoswine, the reluctant builder.

- Lapras and her friend Weavile, here to support (and mock) as needed.

-

The Ice Trial Begins

Dressed in a winter coat and skirt, Lil Eve stepped onto the first platform. It immediately began tilting and sliding. The ice was treacherous. Some platforms looked solid but collapsed if stepped on—others were only stable if burned into firmer shapes.

She carefully climbed, platform by platform. Her Flamethrower Trail skill proved vital—she used it to melt and refreeze unstable panels into walkable surfaces, even dodging wind gusts and slippery tilts that threatened to yeet her into the padded abyss.

After a grueling ascent, she reached the snowy peak. Alolan Ninetales leapt in joy—then immediately slipped off and tumbled back to the bottom.

“I’m okay!” she shouted from below.

“You go congratulate her,” Weavile told Lapras.
“Again,” sighed Mamoswine.

-

Glaceon stepped forward, nodding approvingly.

“You made it. Through madness and frostbite.”

She handed over the Ice Plate, which shimmered in her paws and transformed into a glowing Mini Ice Stone, merging into her. Her coat now gleamed in Glaceon’s color palette, and she gained:

- Cold and slip resistance

- Frost Print – the power to conjure and 3D-print icicle sculptures for tools, weapons, or art.

But peace was short-lived.

Interruption – The Scam from Regice

Unbeknownst to all, high above the arena, Articuno had been lazily watching the entire parkour course from her icy throne cloud, munching on frozen grapes.

Her phone buzzed.

Regice (ID spoofed): “Hello, this is the Free Icicle Challenge Reward Hotline. Please provide your credit card, and an image of the arena’s destruction for... bonus payment.”

Articuno blinked.

“What kind of amateur scam—?”

But before she could hang up, she paused.

“Eh. I won’t get my wings dirty.”

She flipped through a stolen blueprint from Duraludon and assembled a chilling creation:

Articuno-Bot.

-

Articuno-Bot Descends

Without warning, the bot crashed into the dungeon, freezing Lil Eve’s lower body in a block of ice. Glaceon leapt to defend her, but the bot unleashed a Blizzard Pulse, blasting Mamoswine, Lapras, and Weavile into unconsciousness.

Alolan Ninetales, still dusting herself off from her fall, sprang into action.

“Keep your eyes on me, metalhead!”

She smashed into the bot with Dazzling Gleam, then raised ice walls to block its movements.

“Eve! Fireball it! Don’t worry about me—I don’t stay dead!”

The bot jabbed her with an icy spike—but she grinned through it.

“Ow. Worth it.”

Eve ignited, melting herself free with Flamethrower Trail, then spun a blazing arc straight into the Articuno-Bot’s chest. The ice cracked—shattered—and the bot exploded in a burst of wires and cold.

Ninetales dove out of the flames just in time, steaming slightly, then magically regenerated with a sparkle.

“Still immortal,” she smirked.

Epilogue: The Scam Fallout

Back on her cloud, Articuno threw her phone.

“REGICE! You idiot!”

She tried calling back. No response.

Fuming, she printed dozens of anti-scam call posters—“Don’t Trust Regice!”—and began plastering them across the sky.

But before she could even finish, a mischievous Electabuzz swooped in, stole her Duraludon schematics, and ran off with a picture of her fallen brother Zapdos taped to his back.

Articuno sighed.

“Today’s just not my day.”
