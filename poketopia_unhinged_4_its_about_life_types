Opening Scene: 5 Years After the Bot Invasion

The snow whispered across the quiet mountain as Alolan Ninetales, dressed in a flowing white sundress with a pleated skirt, stood near the cliffside, enjoying a long-overdue vacation with her husband, Mamoswine. Beneath her paws, buried under decades of frost and debris, lay rusted remains of the fallen Dragobot—its jagged wreckage recently unearthed by a thawing avalanche.

Near the wreckage sat a small, half-frozen vial with an aged label scrawled in ancient ink:
“Arceus Elixir – Drink to become immortal.”

Ninetales tilted her head, squinting at the bottle. “Really? That’s it?” she scoffed, brushing snow from her dress. “Will I become the strongest?” she asked aloud, partly joking—then, with a shrug, downed the elixir in one smooth gulp.

Mere seconds later, Mamoswine attempted to climb the same slope behind her, but his massive body and age worked against him. He lost his footing and tumbled down the icy incline, crying out in pain. Ninetales dashed toward him instinctively—too recklessly.

She slipped on a patch of ice and was impaled through the chest by a massive shard of jagged dripstone jutting from the rocks below, barely saved Mamoswine.

Mamoswine’s eyes widened in horror. “NINETALES!”

But to his utter disbelief, she gasped, winced—and smiled. “Oopsies... you alright? I was such an idiot, sorry.” She giggled weakly. “Bakatales moment…”

He rushed to her side, gently pulling her from the spike. Her bloodstained dress shimmered—and within seconds, her body healed completely, the fabric restored as if untouched. It dawned on both of them: she couldn’t die. Not anymore. The elixir had worked. The immortality was real.

Moments later, a golden ring shimmered into existence as Hoopa arrived through a portal, drawn by the ancient energy that had just awakened.

“One of the six elixirs…” Hoopa muttered, examining the now-empty bottle. “These were meant to be sealed… reserved for only the most sacred emergencies.”

He stared at Ninetales, now brushing snow off her still-pristine dress. “It’s done. It can’t be undone. And Ho-Oh… he doesn’t have long left. Eight years, at most.”

Eight Years Later (13 Years After the Bot Invasion)

Time marched forward. Mamoswine’s thick coat was now peppered with gray, and his movements had slowed with age. But Alolan Ninetales remained unchanged—her sundress still fluttered gently in the breeze, her beauty untouched by time. Immortal. Unmoving. Unfading.

A gentle knock came at the door of their cozy mountain home.

“Coming!” she called, and opened it to a familiar trio.

“Hey Auntie Tails!” said Lil Eve cheerfully—a teenage Eevee with her mother’s grace and her father’s goofy smile. Behind her stood Vaporeon, now a seasoned lifeguard and part-time aquatic forager, and Flareon, wearing a smart apron and carrying a bag of baked goods, now a full-time chef and part-time blacksmith.

“We brought snowberry pies!” Flareon beamed.

Vaporeon smiled warmly. “And some gifts for your little ones—Piloswine and Alolan Vulpix, right?”

Ninetales chuckled. “They’ll love it. Thank you, both of you.”

Lil Eve tilted her head. “You still look the same, Auntie Tails… even prettier, I think!”

Ninetales forced a laugh, brushing a strand of hair behind her ear. “Thanks, sweetie. Must be the snow.”

Inside, a subtle silence lingered beneath the surface cheer. Vaporeon glanced at her with knowing eyes. Immortality, after all, wasn’t as gentle as the snow made it seem.

Scene: A New Era of Peace

The city skyline shimmered beneath a clean sky, where aerial transport glided past solar towers and floating gardens. Human-shaped AI robots—sleek, expressive, and warm in tone—roamed the streets assisting citizens and Pokémon alike. 

They were all products of Duraludon’s genius, now a renowned AI and robotics engineer whose lab stood tall with neon runes tracing its steel limbs like veins of light. 

For thirteen long, peaceful years, the city had known safety, innovation, and harmony.

Families thrived. Vaporeon and Flareon walked side by side, their daughter Lil Eve now a bright, inquisitive teenager learning both survival and kindness. The dark days of the bot invasion were now historical archive footage, a lesson and a scar.

Scene Shift: Old Gravestones Beneath a Crimson Sunset

Outside the city limits, past the now-defunct battlefield turned into a lush meadow, stood two modest gravestones. One was engraved with a resolute bow and the other a scorched boot: Decidueye and Cinderace, fallen fourteen years ago. Wildflowers had grown around the stones, undisturbed except for one lone visitor.

A shimmering ring swirled open—Hoopa stepped out, solemn for once.

He hovered there in silence, hands folded behind his back, eyes narrowed not in mischief, but memory.

"Fourteen years." he muttered. “Still feels fresh…”

Then, he turned his gaze northeast, where the snowy mountains crowned the horizon. His golden eyes softened with weary respect.

“She figured it out instinctively... that Ninetales. Immortality was never meant for mortals,” he said to no one, “and yet she wears it with grace. A foolish drink. A foolish move. But…”

A faint chuckle escaped his lips, melancholic and wise.

“She saved him. And now he lives longer than he ever would’ve… That dress of hers—heh, not even a scratch on it.”

He looked back at the gravestones.

“…And we, the so-called gods, we can’t touch the Arceus Elixir. Not even sip it. The irony…” His voice tightened. “A drop and we die. No revival. Not even Ho-Oh.”

The wind blew gently, scattering dandelion seeds past his face as if nature itself tried to offer comfort. Hoopa closed the ring and vanished, leaving behind nothing but a ring-shaped impression in the grass and two eternally resting heroes.

[Flashback – 100 Years Ago | The Cosmic Plane]

Shimmering above the mortal realm, on a tranquil, starlit rift of space known only to the divine, Arceus floated in gentle contemplation. The Creator’s presence pulsed like a heartbeat across the firmament. Standing before him were Mew, her form small yet ancient, and her son Mewtwo, composed but curious. Hoopa hovered near the cosmic portal he had summoned, watching vigilantly.

Arceus looked to Mew with a rare glint of serenity.
“We exist to guide, not to dominate. Immortality… is not infinite if forgotten.”

Mew nodded solemnly. “And yet, your existence gives this plane structure. We are pieces of the same pattern.”

Suddenly—BOOM.

A rupture tore through the plane. A swirling black hole of artificial origin exploded into the realm. Mewtwo was flung into Hoopa’s portal, vanishing unconscious. Hoopa was knocked back, and the celestial plane shook.

Regigigas emerged, draped in brutal tech and clad in malice.
Behind him came Regice, Registeel, and Regirock—each enhanced with armor etched in forbidden glyphs. Soon after, Regieleki and Regidrago encircled Hoopa, cutting off escape.

“Immortality… is wasted on gods with rules,” Regigigas growled. “I will take it… for us.”

Arceus charged, light radiating in a holy pulse. Mew darted to his defense—
—but was surrounded and bound by the three Regi titans.

Hoopa’s rings cracked as he entered Unbound Form, lashing portals and energy in a desperate defense, barely holding his ground.

But then—the needle.
Forged in shadows, built to pierce the divine.

Regigigas drove it deep into Arceus’ chest.

Time froze.

The Creator cried out—not in pain, but finality. As his form unraveled into radiant dust, six luminous vials materialized from his vanishing core—the Arceus Elixirs.
Each one glowed with life eternal… and a curse.

Mew broke free in anguish and, with Hoopa’s help, unleashed a vortex sealed in an ancient void. The six Regi monsters were sucked in, screaming, sealed beneath the world in a dimensionless prison.

As the rift began to close, a faint ghostly echo of Arceus appeared, whispering to Mew and Hoopa:

“The Elixirs… grant what I once bore…
But beware… they do not heal… they do not forgive…
They are not for gods. They are not for the weak.
Only those who choose the burden… shall survive eternity.”

Mewtwo reappeared, breathless, watching his fallen origin vanish into nothing. He said nothing. No one did.

Hoopa sealed the Elixirs away, high in the frozen mountains, far from legend and light.

-

[Present Day – Earth’s Crust Beneath the North]

A thunderous quake. The old void ruptures.

Six titanic figures step out.

Cracked armor. Red eyes. Ancient fury.
The Regi Six... had returned.

Regigigas cracked its joints and raised its arms high.

“Free... at last. The world has forgotten.
But we will remind it.
Immortality… will make us gods.”

He laughed. Madly. Deeply. Without fear.

“With no death, there is no consequence. And with no consequence—there is no law.”

[Present Day – Poketopia City | Psychic Chapter Begins]

Though danger brewed silently on the opposite side of the world, Poketopia City basked in sunshine and technological serenity. Elevated rail pods zipped between gleaming towers. Holograms danced in the air. Robots—both utilitarian and aesthetic—walked among Pokémon and humans alike in perfect sync.

Mew, floating with casual grace, scrolled through the PokéNet on her sleek touchscreen pad. She smiled.

“Five stars. Espeon’s Library… this place has evolved well.”

She glanced at Mewtwo, who stood beside her in silent observation. Cloaked, his expression was unreadable—but he gave a silent nod. He’d saved many cities under Mew’s quiet requests, often anonymously. This time felt more… personal.

With a ripple of space, Hoopa emerged beside them and opened a swirling ring.

“Your portal to Poketopia awaits! Try not to destroy anything this time, Mewtwo.”

Mew giggled. Mewtwo merely exhaled through his nose.

They arrived.

The city was even more dazzling in person. Neon gardens climbed up smart-glass skyscrapers. Drone-winged Pidgeots soared with style. Beneath all of it stood a majestic art-deco style building—Espeon’s Library.

They stepped inside.

“Welcome,” said Espeon, her violet eyes kind and piercing all at once. Though she now looked like a 40-something grandmother, her coat was still sleek, her expression sharp. “You’ve arrived just in time for quiet hour.”

Beside her, Duraludon, now a respected AI and robotic engineer, bowed slightly. His long, metal frame had subtle upgrades, and a technician’s monocle gleamed on his head fin.

Mew’s eyes twinkled as she floated through the high-vaulted hall.

“This is marvelous… robots working in harmony with knowledge.”

Duraludon’s robotic maid—sleek, humanoid, and wearing a bowtie—offered trays of herbal tea to everyone.

Mewtwo, on the other hand, walked directly up to Espeon and asked flatly:

“Do you have family?”

Espeon blinked, amused. “A granddaughter. She loves singing. You’ll hear her in the music wing sometimes.”

Hoopa hovered nearby, raising an eyebrow.

“She doesn’t look like a grandma.”

Mew laughed with delight. “No wrinkles, no cane, no creaks. I should borrow your skincare routine!”

Mewtwo chuckled—a rare sound.

“This city really is unhinged.”

As they explored, they passed Delphox, who had just closed a book titled Mind Beyond Matter: Advanced Psychic Type Mastery. She was older now, eyes serene, and had two children waiting at home. She offered a gentle nod to the group.

But as she passed by the DNA section, one of the nearby books lit up faintly red in her holo pocket crystal—a subtle flicker, barely noticed.

Curious, she joined the impromptu psychic circle forming at the corner lounge: Espeon, Mew, Mewtwo, and herself.

They began discussing psychic evolution, intergenerational memory, and how emotions affected mind-reading precision. It was peaceful. Civil. Illuminating.

Duraludon’s maid-bots poured more tea. Outside, the sky dimmed into evening. The city’s lights shimmered alive.

-

Far away… beneath the crust… the Regi Six stirred.
