Opening Scene: 5 Years After the Bot Invasion

The snow whispered across the quiet mountain as Alolan Ninetales, dressed in a flowing white sundress with a pleated skirt, stood near the cliffside, enjoying a long-overdue vacation with her husband, Mamoswine. Beneath her paws, buried under decades of frost and debris, lay rusted remains of the fallen Dragobot—its jagged wreckage recently unearthed by a thawing avalanche.

Near the wreckage sat a small, half-frozen vial with an aged label scrawled in ancient ink:
“Arceus Elixir – Drink to become immortal.”

Ninetales tilted her head, squinting at the bottle. “Really? That’s it?” she scoffed, brushing snow from her dress. “Will I become the strongest?” she asked aloud, partly joking—then, with a shrug, downed the elixir in one smooth gulp.

Mere seconds later, Mamoswine attempted to climb the same slope behind her, but his massive body and age worked against him. He lost his footing and tumbled down the icy incline, crying out in pain. Ninetales dashed toward him instinctively—too recklessly.

She slipped on a patch of ice and was impaled through the chest by a massive shard of jagged dripstone jutting from the rocks below, barely saved Mamoswine.

Mamoswine’s eyes widened in horror. “NINETALES!”

But to his utter disbelief, she gasped, winced—and smiled. “Oopsies... you alright? I was such an idiot, sorry.” She giggled weakly. “Bakatales moment…”

He rushed to her side, gently pulling her from the spike. Her bloodstained dress shimmered—and within seconds, her body healed completely, the fabric restored as if untouched. It dawned on both of them: she couldn’t die. Not anymore. The elixir had worked. The immortality was real.

Moments later, a golden ring shimmered into existence as Hoopa arrived through a portal, drawn by the ancient energy that had just awakened.

“One of the six elixirs…” Hoopa muttered, examining the now-empty bottle. “These were meant to be sealed… reserved for only the most sacred emergencies.”

He stared at Ninetales, now brushing snow off her still-pristine dress. “It’s done. It can’t be undone. And Ho-Oh… he doesn’t have long left. Eight years, at most.”

Eight Years Later (13 Years After the Bot Invasion)

Time marched forward. Mamoswine’s thick coat was now peppered with gray, and his movements had slowed with age. But Alolan Ninetales remained unchanged—her sundress still fluttered gently in the breeze, her beauty untouched by time. Immortal. Unmoving. Unfading.

A gentle knock came at the door of their cozy mountain home.

“Coming!” she called, and opened it to a familiar trio.

“Hey Auntie Tails!” said Lil Eve cheerfully—a teenage Eevee with her mother’s grace and her father’s goofy smile. Behind her stood Vaporeon, now a seasoned lifeguard and part-time aquatic forager, and Flareon, wearing a smart apron and carrying a bag of baked goods, now a full-time chef and part-time blacksmith.

“We brought snowberry pies!” Flareon beamed.

Vaporeon smiled warmly. “And some gifts for your little ones—Piloswine and Alolan Vulpix, right?”

Ninetales chuckled. “They’ll love it. Thank you, both of you.”

Lil Eve tilted her head. “You still look the same, Auntie Tails… even prettier, I think!”

Ninetales forced a laugh, brushing a strand of hair behind her ear. “Thanks, sweetie. Must be the snow.”

Inside, a subtle silence lingered beneath the surface cheer. Vaporeon glanced at her with knowing eyes. Immortality, after all, wasn’t as gentle as the snow made it seem.

Scene: A New Era of Peace

The city skyline shimmered beneath a clean sky, where aerial transport glided past solar towers and floating gardens. Human-shaped AI robots—sleek, expressive, and warm in tone—roamed the streets assisting citizens and Pokémon alike. They were all products of Duraludon’s genius, now a renowned AI and robotics engineer whose lab stood tall with neon runes tracing its steel limbs like veins of light. For thirteen long, peaceful years, the city had known safety, innovation, and harmony.

Families thrived. Vaporeon and Flareon walked side by side, their daughter Lil Eve now a bright, inquisitive teenager learning both survival and kindness. The dark days of the bot invasion were now historical archive footage, a lesson and a scar.

Scene Shift: Old Gravestones Beneath a Crimson Sunset

Outside the city limits, past the now-defunct battlefield turned into a lush meadow, stood two modest gravestones. One was engraved with a resolute bow and the other a scorched boot: Decidueye and Cinderace, fallen fourteen years ago. Wildflowers had grown around the stones, undisturbed except for one lone visitor.

A shimmering ring swirled open—Hoopa stepped out, solemn for once.

He hovered there in silence, hands folded behind his back, eyes narrowed not in mischief, but memory.

"Fourteen years." he muttered. “Still feels fresh…”

Then, he turned his gaze northeast, where the snowy mountains crowned the horizon. His golden eyes softened with weary respect.

“She figured it out instinctively... that Ninetales. Immortality was never meant for mortals,” he said to no one, “and yet she wears it with grace. A foolish drink. A foolish move. But…”

A faint chuckle escaped his lips, melancholic and wise.

“She saved him. And now he lives longer than he ever would’ve… That dress of hers—heh, not even a scratch on it.”

He looked back at the gravestones.

“…And we, the so-called gods, we can’t touch the Arceus Elixir. Not even sip it. The irony…” His voice tightened. “A drop and we die. No revival. Not even Ho-Oh.”

The wind blew gently, scattering dandelion seeds past his face as if nature itself tried to offer comfort. Hoopa closed the ring and vanished, leaving behind nothing but a ring-shaped impression in the grass and two eternally resting heroes.
