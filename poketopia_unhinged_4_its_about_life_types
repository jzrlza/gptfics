Opening Scene: 5 Years After the Bot Invasion

The snow whispered across the quiet mountain as Alolan Ninetales, dressed in a flowing white sundress with a pleated skirt, stood near the cliffside, enjoying a long-overdue vacation with her husband, Mamoswine. Beneath her paws, buried under decades of frost and debris, lay rusted remains of the fallen Dragobot—its jagged wreckage recently unearthed by a thawing avalanche.

Near the wreckage sat a small, half-frozen vial with an aged label scrawled in ancient ink:
“Arceus Elixir – Drink to become immortal.”

Ninetales tilted her head, squinting at the bottle. “Really? That’s it?” she scoffed, brushing snow from her dress. “Will I become the strongest?” she asked aloud, partly joking—then, with a shrug, downed the elixir in one smooth gulp.

Mere seconds later, Mamoswine attempted to climb the same slope behind her, but his massive body and age worked against him. He lost his footing and tumbled down the icy incline, crying out in pain. Ninetales dashed toward him instinctively—too recklessly.

She slipped on a patch of ice and was impaled through the chest by a massive shard of jagged dripstone jutting from the rocks below, barely saved Mamoswine.

Mamoswine’s eyes widened in horror. “NINETALES!”

But to his utter disbelief, she gasped, winced—and smiled. “Oopsies... you alright? I was such an idiot, sorry.” She giggled weakly. “Bakatales moment…”

He rushed to her side, gently pulling her from the spike. Her bloodstained dress shimmered—and within seconds, her body healed completely, the fabric restored as if untouched. It dawned on both of them: she couldn’t die. Not anymore. The elixir had worked. The immortality was real.

Moments later, a golden ring shimmered into existence as Hoopa arrived through a portal, drawn by the ancient energy that had just awakened.

“One of the six elixirs…” Hoopa muttered, examining the now-empty bottle. “These were meant to be sealed… reserved for only the most sacred emergencies.”

He stared at Ninetales, now brushing snow off her still-pristine dress. “It’s done. It can’t be undone. And Ho-Oh… he doesn’t have long left. Eight years, at most.”

-

Eight Years Later (13 Years After the Bot Invasion)

Time marched forward. Mamoswine’s thick coat was now peppered with gray, and his movements had slowed with age. But Alolan Ninetales remained unchanged—her sundress still fluttered gently in the breeze, her beauty untouched by time. Immortal. Unmoving. Unfading.

A gentle knock came at the door of their cozy mountain home.

“Coming!” she called, and opened it to a familiar trio.

“Hey Auntie Tails!” said Lil Eve cheerfully—a teenage Eevee with her mother’s grace and her father’s goofy smile. Behind her stood Vaporeon, now a seasoned lifeguard and part-time aquatic forager, and Flareon, wearing a smart apron and carrying a bag of baked goods, now a full-time chef and part-time blacksmith.

“We brought snowberry pies!” Flareon beamed.

Vaporeon smiled warmly. “And some gifts for your little ones—Piloswine and Alolan Vulpix, right?”

Ninetales chuckled. “They’ll love it. Thank you, both of you.”

Lil Eve tilted her head. “You still look the same, Auntie Tails… even prettier, I think!”

Ninetales forced a laugh, brushing a strand of hair behind her ear. “Thanks, sweetie. Must be the snow.”

Inside, a subtle silence lingered beneath the surface cheer. Vaporeon glanced at her with knowing eyes. Immortality, after all, wasn’t as gentle as the snow made it seem.

Scene: A New Era of Peace

The city skyline shimmered beneath a clean sky, where aerial transport glided past solar towers and floating gardens. Human-shaped AI robots—sleek, expressive, and warm in tone—roamed the streets assisting citizens and Pokémon alike. 

They were all products of Duraludon’s genius, now a renowned AI and robotics engineer whose lab stood tall with neon runes tracing its steel limbs like veins of light. 

For thirteen long, peaceful years, the city had known safety, innovation, and harmony.

Families thrived. Vaporeon and Flareon walked side by side, their daughter Lil Eve now a bright, inquisitive teenager learning both survival and kindness. The dark days of the bot invasion were now historical archive footage, a lesson and a scar.

-

Scene Shift: Old Gravestones Beneath a Crimson Sunset

Outside the city limits, past the now-defunct battlefield turned into a lush meadow, stood two modest gravestones. One was engraved with a resolute bow and the other a scorched boot: Decidueye and Cinderace, fallen fourteen years ago. Wildflowers had grown around the stones, undisturbed except for one lone visitor.

A shimmering ring swirled open—Hoopa stepped out, solemn for once.

He hovered there in silence, hands folded behind his back, eyes narrowed not in mischief, but memory.

"Fourteen years." he muttered. “Still feels fresh…”

Then, he turned his gaze northeast, where the snowy mountains crowned the horizon. His golden eyes softened with weary respect.

“She figured it out instinctively... that Ninetales. Immortality was never meant for mortals,” he said to no one, “and yet she wears it with grace. A foolish drink. A foolish move. But…”

A faint chuckle escaped his lips, melancholic and wise.

“She saved him. And now he lives longer than he ever would’ve… That dress of hers—heh, not even a scratch on it.”

He looked back at the gravestones.

“…And we, the so-called gods, we can’t touch the Arceus Elixir. Not even sip it. The irony…” His voice tightened. “A drop and we die. No revival. Not even Ho-Oh.”

The wind blew gently, scattering dandelion seeds past his face as if nature itself tried to offer comfort. Hoopa closed the ring and vanished, leaving behind nothing but a ring-shaped impression in the grass and two eternally resting heroes.


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


[Flashback – 100 Years Ago | The Cosmic Plane]

Shimmering above the mortal realm, on a tranquil, starlit rift of space known only to the divine, Arceus floated in gentle contemplation. The Creator’s presence pulsed like a heartbeat across the firmament. Standing before him were Mew, her form small yet ancient, and her son Mewtwo, composed but curious. Hoopa hovered near the cosmic portal he had summoned, watching vigilantly.

Arceus looked to Mew with a rare glint of serenity.
“We exist to guide, not to dominate. Immortality… is not infinite if forgotten.”

Mew nodded solemnly. “And yet, your existence gives this plane structure. We are pieces of the same pattern.”

Suddenly—BOOM.

A rupture tore through the plane. A swirling black hole of artificial origin exploded into the realm. Mewtwo was flung into Hoopa’s portal, vanishing unconscious. Hoopa was knocked back, and the celestial plane shook.

Regigigas emerged, draped in brutal tech and clad in malice.
Behind him came Regice, Registeel, and Regirock—each enhanced with armor etched in forbidden glyphs. Soon after, Regieleki and Regidrago encircled Hoopa, cutting off escape.

“Immortality… is wasted on gods with rules,” Regigigas growled. “I will take it… for us.”

Arceus charged, light radiating in a holy pulse. Mew darted to his defense—
—but was surrounded and bound by the three Regi titans.

Hoopa’s rings cracked as he entered Unbound Form, lashing portals and energy in a desperate defense, barely holding his ground.

But then—the needle.
Forged in shadows, built to pierce the divine.

Regigigas drove it deep into Arceus’ chest.

Time froze.

The Creator cried out—not in pain, but finality. As his form unraveled into radiant dust, six luminous vials materialized from his vanishing core—the Arceus Elixirs.
Each one glowed with life eternal… and a curse.

Mew broke free in anguish and, with Hoopa’s help, unleashed a vortex sealed in an ancient void. The six Regi monsters were sucked in, screaming, sealed beneath the world in a dimensionless prison.

As the rift began to close, a faint ghostly echo of Arceus appeared, whispering to Mew and Hoopa:

“The Elixirs… grant what I once bore…
But beware… they do not heal… they do not forgive…
They are not for gods. They are not for the weak.
Only those who choose the burden… shall survive eternity.”

Mewtwo reappeared, breathless, watching his fallen origin vanish into nothing. He said nothing. No one did.

Hoopa sealed the Elixirs away, high in the frozen mountains, far from legend and light.

-

[Present Day – Earth’s Crust Beneath the North]

A thunderous quake. The old void ruptures.

Six titanic figures step out.

Cracked armor. Red eyes. Ancient fury.
The Regi Six... had returned.

Regigigas cracked its joints and raised its arms high.

“Free... at last. The world has forgotten.
But we will remind it.
Immortality… will make us gods.”

He laughed. Madly. Deeply. Without fear.

“With no death, there is no consequence. And with no consequence—there is no law.”


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


[Present Day – Poketopia City | Psychic Chapter Begins]

Though danger brewed silently on the opposite side of the world, Poketopia City basked in sunshine and technological serenity. Elevated rail pods zipped between gleaming towers. Holograms danced in the air. Robots—both utilitarian and aesthetic—walked among Pokémon and humans alike in perfect sync.

Mew, floating with casual grace, scrolled through the PokéNet on her sleek touchscreen pad. She smiled.

“Five stars. Espeon’s Library… this place has evolved well.”

She glanced at Mewtwo, who stood beside her in silent observation. Cloaked, his expression was unreadable—but he gave a silent nod. He’d saved many cities under Mew’s quiet requests, often anonymously. This time felt more… personal.

With a ripple of space, Hoopa emerged beside them and opened a swirling ring.

“Your portal to Poketopia awaits! Try not to destroy anything this time, Mewtwo.”

Mew giggled. Mewtwo merely exhaled through his nose.

They arrived.

The city was even more dazzling in person. Neon gardens climbed up smart-glass skyscrapers. Drone-winged Pidgeots soared with style. Beneath all of it stood a majestic art-deco style building—Espeon’s Library.

They stepped inside.

“Welcome,” said Espeon, her violet eyes kind and piercing all at once. Though she now looked like a 40-something grandmother, her coat was still sleek, her expression sharp. “You’ve arrived just in time for quiet hour.”

Beside her, Duraludon, now a respected AI and robotic engineer, bowed slightly. His long, metal frame had subtle upgrades, and a technician’s monocle gleamed on his head fin.

Mew’s eyes twinkled as she floated through the high-vaulted hall.

“This is marvelous… robots working in harmony with knowledge.”

Duraludon’s robotic maid—sleek, humanoid, and wearing a bowtie—offered trays of herbal tea to everyone.

Mewtwo, on the other hand, walked directly up to Espeon and asked flatly:

“Do you have family?”

Espeon blinked, amused. “A granddaughter. She loves singing. You’ll hear her in the music wing sometimes.”

Hoopa hovered nearby, raising an eyebrow.

“She doesn’t look like a grandma.”

Mew laughed with delight. “No wrinkles, no cane, no creaks. I should borrow your skincare routine!”

Mewtwo chuckled—a rare sound.

“This city really is unhinged.”

As they explored, they passed Delphox, who had just closed a book titled Mind Beyond Matter: Advanced Psychic Type Mastery. She was older now, eyes serene, and had two children waiting at home. She offered a gentle nod to the group.

But as she passed by the DNA section, one of the nearby books lit up faintly red in her holo pocket crystal—a subtle flicker, barely noticed.

Curious, she joined the impromptu psychic circle forming at the corner lounge: Espeon, Mew, Mewtwo, and herself.

They began discussing psychic evolution, intergenerational memory, and how emotions affected mind-reading precision. It was peaceful. Civil. Illuminating.

Duraludon’s maid-bots poured more tea. Outside, the sky dimmed into evening. The city’s lights shimmered alive.

-

Far away… beneath the crust… the Regi Six stirred.


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

[Poketopia Library – Psychic Symposium, Present Day]

It was another vibrant day in Poketopia City. The air smelled like synth-flowers and steaming mochi from automated street stalls. Inside the chrome-and-crystal halls of Espeon’s Library, the psychic types gathered once more.

Gardevoir entered gracefully, giving a fond wave to her Kirlia daughter and Lucario, her husband, before joining the meeting.

From another side, Galarian Rapidash, glowing with mystic elegance, nuzzled her dark spectral husband Gastrier affectionately. He gave a brief whinny before cantering off to his herd—a harem composed of Spectrier, Mudsdale, Zebstrika, and Kantonian Rapidash. Their shared son, Keldeo, trailed behind his unicorn mother, enchanted by the library’s science and mythology section.

Delphox soon joined with her gifted psychic students. She had waved to Greninja and their Froakie son, who were off to swimming class, while their Braixen daughter simply came to spectate with a popsicle in hand.

At the round table, waiting with a mix of calm and caffeine, sat Espeon (librarian and curator), Mew, Mewtwo, and Hoopa.

| “Let’s begin,” Espeon purred, floating a clipboard made of psychic light.

But before the first topic was spoken, Mewtwo, ever the stoic instigator, suddenly gestured at the ancient holo-timer on the table.

| “Let’s peer through time. I want to see something... primal.”

Delphox’s crystal flickered as the time viewer swirled to life, and soon, the psychics beheld…

-

[1000 Years Ago – Ancient Poketopia Prehistoric Times]

Through the mists of time, they watched:

A hulking male Tyrantrum, wearing a caveman loincloth, thundered through a jungle, chasing a frightened female Aurorus in equally crude cave attire. Her crystals shimmered in fear—but she was clever.

She dashed toward a glade, where a noble being awaited: Koraidon, great-great-grandfather to today’s Miraidon. He knelt, presenting fish he had caught—a peace offering.

Aurorus took the fish gently. Though a vegan, she understood: this was survival. She returned and, with trembling hooves, offered them to the pursuing Tyrantrum.

Tyrantrum, breathing heavily, blinked.

| “You fed me? Not ran? Not fought? …Wife material.”

Aurorus blushed.

| “Feeding is love. Let’s build… something together.”

That moment, recorded by fate, sparked the founding of the very first stone shelter in what would one day become Poketopia—a line that would eventually birth Tyranitar.

Hoopa was stunned. “Did we just watch a censored dinosaur romcom?!”

Everyone was too shocked to speak.

-


[Fast-Forward: 69 Years Ago – The Scam Saga]

The timeline flickered again. This time they saw:

A younger Zapdos, feathered in gold-tinted business attire, hawking a shady immortality “potion” to Type: Null behind a dumpster made of old PC Boxes. Nearby, Rayquaza, suspiciously dressed like a shady guru, tried to upsell a “Dragon Coin” NFT scam.

Articuno, standing beside them in a sleek winter coat, rolled her eyes.

“Disgusting. I’d steal immortality through honest evil, not pyramid schemes.”

Null, however, had enough. He trapped Zapdos in a golden cube. But not before Zapdos activated his moon-sized bomb implant, sealing himself beneath what would become Tyranitar’s Manor.

Rayquaza, left behind, barely survived over the decades—scraping by from duping MLM hopefuls and installing the cursed Timi Timmy Co. logo into his chest.

The scars remained—literally. One shaped like a rocky claw… made him shiver.

-

[28 Years Ago – Darkrai’s Mistake]

Darkrai, still a heartbroken young adult from his Wigglytuff breakup, wandered past. Rayquaza pounced.

“Sign up for this crypto cult and get six stars! …Also immortality.”

Darkrai, vulnerable and debt-ridden, joined.

The rest was unhinged history.

-

[Back to Present – Poketopia Library]

The viewer powered down. Silence fell upon the psychics.

Mew turned to Hoopa. “That was… a lot.”

Hoopa nodded. “I need tea and possibly therapy.”

Mewtwo simply folded his arms.

“So that’s why Rayquaza keeps dying to Tyranitar.”

Gardevoir rubbed her temples. “And Zapdos is worse than we thought.”

Delphox sipped her tea. “I feel like I just read five separate soap operas crammed into one.”

Espeon sighed.

“This timeline is more cursed than I cataloged. But I can’t stop reading.”

Everyone nodded solemnly. Somewhere, Keldeo sneezed in the science wing.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


[Poketopia – The Eight Plates Ceremony]

The ancient vision had left the psychic types deep in thought. But there was little time to reflect. The threat of the Regi Six loomed, and the Arceus Elixirs still held dangerous mysteries.

Then, in the shimmering heart of the library, Hoopa appeared again—this time with a solemn expression and arms full of glowing artifacts.

“It’s time,” Hoopa said. “The Plates must return to the ones who still carry Arceus’ intent. Especially... to her.”

He floated the Psychic Plate toward Espeon, whose eyes widened.

Delphox, standing nearby, closed her book and whispered, “It’s her time. Your granddaughter, Lil Eve… she must inherit all eight elemental virtues. Only then will she be ready.”

Espeon trembled. “Lil Eve… is ready?”

Delphox nodded. “She’s the spark that bridges every path. The child of two elements, descended from hope and flame.”

-

[Over the Next Days – The Plates Are Passed On]

One by one, Hoopa visited the city's most trusted and legendary Eeveelutions—each of whom had touched Lil Eve’s life in some way:

- The Dark Plate was given to Doctor Umbreon, Espeon’s loyal husband, as he exited his shift at the nocturnal clinic.

- The Fire Plate was handed to Flareon, Lil Eve’s father, while he worked in the city’s geothermal greenhouse cooking there.

- The Water Plate went to Vaporeon, Lil Eve’s gentle mother, beside the tranquil memorial lake where Decidueye and Cinderace’s stones stood.

- The Ice Plate was delivered to Glaceon, Vaporeon’s wise mother, found meditating under frozen waterfalls in the Winter Gardens.

- The Grass Plate was given to Leafeon, her serene grandfather, tending to bonsai forests on floating tree platforms.

- The Electric Plate was entrusted to Officer Jolteon, her protective uncle figure, fresh off disabling a rogue vending bot.

- The Fairy Plate went to Sylveon, her elegant aunt and a schoolteacher known for nurturing young minds with poetry and song.

And at last, all eight gathered under one roof—the grand skylit Library of Poketopia.

Lil Eve stood at the center, glowing faintly with inner light, the Plates arranged around her like petals.

-

[The Ceremony – Words from Urshifu]

Stepping forward from the gathering crowd came Urshifu, a wanderer of myth, flanked by his friends Zeraora and Sceptile, both nodding in silent respect.

Urshifu addressed Lil Eve with a voice like thunder in rain:

“You stand on the path of life types—not just in name, but in soul. To master all eight is to understand the world beyond combat. Listen well…”

He raised his paw as each Plate shimmered.

- Grass: “Tests balance. Without harmony in temperature, nothing grows. You must learn when to yield and when to root.”

- Water: “Tests direction. Flow without panic. Swim not just with strength, but purpose.”

- Fire: “Tests temper. Fire creates, warms, comforts—when you will it, not when you lose it.”

- Ice: “Tests preservation. Calm yourself, even when everything slips away.”

- Fairy: “Tests the art of presence. Beauty, kindness, and charm—they shape how others feel your power.”

- Dark: “Tests justice. Not all that’s right is gentle. Learn to see through shadows, and strike without cruelty.”

- Psychic: “Tests wisdom. See the unseen. Solve the puzzle that is yourself.”

- Electric: “Tests speed and consequence. A surge gives life—or ends it. Control the charge within.”

Lil Eve, silent and steady, bowed. She understood. These were not just types—they were ways to live.

Urshifu smiled, placing his paw over her heart.

| “You are not your powers. You are what you do with them.”

With a nod to Espeon and Flareon, he turned. Zeraora and Sceptile were already waiting. As the three legends vanished into golden sparks, the library was left in reverent silence.

Lil Eve closed her eyes. The journey had begun.
