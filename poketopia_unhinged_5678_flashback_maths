Post Chapter 100

This is a surreal, heartfelt 2nd spin-off of Pokétopia: Unhinged 1-4 series, continued from 1st spin-off, Pokétopia: Unhinged Infinity - Immortal Loop Waltz. While you don't need to read the original quadrilogy to enjoy this, but you will get it much better, as it focuses more in absurd time jumps and flashback of the original casts.

[Scene 1 – Two Childhood Friends]
Time: 4,101,000,942 years before previous spin-off's Chapter 100, 121 years before Saga 1 (first fiction of the series)
Location: Pokeplanet – Quiet Meadow, Beneath the Ancient Trees

The breeze was light. The grass swayed in time with the distant ocean’s breath.

Meloetta, her green hair shimmering under the sun, hummed a soft tune as she sat beneath the giant tree. Beside her, Celebi, their small form glowing faintly, traced spirals in the air with a curious stick.

Celebi:
"Do you think we’ll always have time like this?"

Meloetta:
"Of course. You're my best friend, Celebi. You always know how to make the days longer."

Celebi (grinning):
"Longer? Heh. I can make them endless if I want to."

They laughed together, unaware of the storms the future held.

-

[Scene 2 – The Titans Walk the Earth]
Time: Still in the flashback.
Location: Coastal City – Shadowed by Titans

Manaphy, prince of the sea, often walked with Meloetta near the shore. His playful nature faltered whenever the Regi Titans appeared, their towering forms silent, their gazes unknowable.

Manaphy (whispering, clutching Meloetta’s hand):
"The way Regigigas stares… It’s as if he already knows something I don’t. I don’t like it."

Meloetta (softly, gripping his hand tighter):
"Then look at me instead."

They didn’t know it yet, but Regigigas, obsessed with escaping mortality after his cosmic-scale scam collapse, was already spiraling.

-

[Scene 3 – The Fall of Arceus]
Time Jump: 4,101,000,892.3 years before previous spin-off's Chapter 100, 71.3 Years Before Saga 1
Location: Hidden Grove, Post-Arceus’ Death

The world shook with unholy news. Arceus was dead. Regigigas had done the impossible.

Hoopa (fuming):
"We sealed the titans. Used Celebi’s time-lock tech. But..."

Mew (guiltily, looking away):
"The seal’s backlash almost killed Manaphy. We didn’t mean..."

Celebi (staggered):
"No. No, not him. Manaphy’s not a player in this game!"

Meloetta had no time to waste.
She found Manaphy, limp, barely breathing.

Meloetta (tears falling, holding him tightly):
"Why… why did you get caught in this?"

Manaphy (weak smile):
"If I must be trapped, let me be trapped like this… in your arms."

Meloetta:
"There has to be a way. I won’t let this be the end."

Celebi (quietly):
"There is. One jump. A one-way portal. Time… but it changes the jumper. You’ll be immortal. You may lose more than you gain."

Meloetta (without hesitation):
"Open it."

Celebi (softly, almost pleading):
"Are you sure?"

Meloetta:
"Manaphy chose to stay in my arms. I’ll choose to stay with him forever."

They vanished into the wormhole.

[To Be Conitnued...]

Ch 2 : The Beginning of Carry Immortality Pt 2

[Scene 4 – The Birth of Bridal-Carry Immortality]
Time: About 11 Billion Years before previous spin-off's Chapter 100, 4.9 Billion Years Before Saga 1
Location: Erosbloom-89, Before Sentience Awakened

Meloetta awoke under pink skies. The air was raw and untouched.

Manaphy’s body remained motionless, but his voice still whispered. His face still smiled.

Manaphy (lightly):
"Guess you’re stuck with me, huh?"

Meloetta (brushing his face, firm but kind):
"Forever isn’t long enough."

The centuries passed. She built a machine, a massive, glimmering hourglass device. Its rules were strict:

- Bridal carry is the conduit.

- Both partners must accept the cost.

- Immortality comes with emotional gravity.

Meloetta carried Manaphy back to his watery cave after each experiment. He teased her about her obsession. She teased him about being dead weight.

But the comfort spread.

A few desperate couples came. Then more.
The first immortals bloomed quietly on this untouched world.

And Meloetta stayed by Manaphy’s side, always carrying him, always listening to his soft jokes across millennia.

-

[Scene 5 – The Telelink Realization]
Time: Still in the Distant Past, 11 billion years ago, Erosbloom-89

The centuries melted into millennia.

Meloetta noticed something.
Her created immortal couples, those who stepped into her bridal-carry hourglass machine, were different from her.

They couldn’t let go.

They were forever bound, not just by choice but by law of the machine.
Meloetta could still set Manaphy down.
She could walk freely.
Yet they were still connected, always.

So she crafted something new.
A Telelink.
A psychic thread, refined through her and Manaphy’s minds, that allowed distant couples to speak, even across worlds.

Manaphy once joked:
"Guess you just didn’t want people yelling for you through wormholes anymore."

But Meloetta’s smile didn’t fade.
"If they’re desperate enough to call… I’ll catch them."

She had already built it, a subconscious wormhole catcher.
A net that would sense the rare, desperate cries of lovers who would rather cross time and space than be torn apart.

Over eons, she quietly became the cosmic comforter.
The one who gave them the chance she once fought to claim.

-

[Scene 6 – The Present Day, Evoir – The Watchers]
Time: Present Day
Location: Planet Evoir, Chronoscene Reflector Room

The memory faded.

The vision dissolved like mist.

Alolan Ninetales blinked, her fluffy tail draped lazily over the edge of the cliff they’d gathered on. Her ice shimmered under the setting sun.

Alolan Ninetales (softly, breaking the silence):
"So… the bridal-carry immortality, the wormhole calls, the entire comfort system..."
She exhaled, her breath freezing in the air.
"...it all traces back to him. Regigigas. The absolute madman who set it all in motion."

Gardevoir (smiling faintly):
"The mad godfather of immortality."

Flareon let out a quiet hum. Vaporeon, without a word, reached down, hoisting him into her arms with practiced ease.
She smirked.
"Then we owe him our forever."

Lil Eve sat cross-legged, her head tilted as she pondered.
"But… it wasn’t supposed to be like this, right? It started as a scam, then became a war, then somehow turned into… comfort."

Keldeo crossed his arms, looking into the distance.
"Sometimes the cosmic joke has a punchline that still feels good."

Dragonvee adjusted her maid headband, then snugged Verdantvee closer in her arms.
"You know, Verdant… I wouldn’t be here without that maniac’s ripple effects."

Verdantvee (smiling softly):
"Yeah, me neither. I guess we’re all echoes of his disaster."

Divavee spun gently, bridal-carrying Boggyvee with her usual flair.
"A disaster that bloomed into something strangely… sweet."

Boggyvee (grinning):
"The strongest comfort comes from the loudest falls, huh?"

They laughed, not loudly, just enough to breathe in the weight of it all.

-

[Scene 7 – Meanwhile… The Mad Godfather]
Location: Distant Planet, Mortill-Shim, Far from Evoir

Regigigas dusted his hands, the remains of a collapsed war settlement at his feet. He had just averted another planetary self-destruction.

Regigigas (to himself, almost bored):
"Another one saved. Tch. These mortals still don’t know how to carry each other."

He gazed up, the echoes of bridal-carry bonds drifting faintly in his mind.

Regigigas (soft chuckle):
"But some of them… some of them figured it out."

Without fanfare, without seeking thanks, he turned away. His journey wasn’t over.

Somewhere, someone else would be desperate enough to call.
And the cosmic comfort.
The impossible wormhole.
Would still answer.
