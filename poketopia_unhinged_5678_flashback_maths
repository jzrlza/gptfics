Post Chapter 100

This is a surreal, heartfelt 2nd spin-off of Pokétopia: Unhinged 1-4 series, continued from 1st spin-off, Pokétopia: Unhinged Infinity - Immortal Loop Waltz. While you don't need to read the original quadrilogy (+1 spin-off) to enjoy this, but you will get it much better, as it focuses more in absurd time jumps and flashback of the original casts.

[Scene 1 – Two Childhood Friends]
Time: 4,101,000,942 years before previous spin-off's Chapter 100, 121 years before Saga 1 (first fiction of the series)
Location: Pokeplanet – Quiet Meadow, Beneath the Ancient Trees

The breeze was light. The grass swayed in time with the distant ocean’s breath.

Meloetta, her green hair shimmering under the sun, hummed a soft tune as she sat beneath the giant tree. Beside her, Celebi, their small form glowing faintly, traced spirals in the air with a curious stick.

Celebi: "Do you think we’ll always have time like this?"

Meloetta: "Of course. You're my best friend, Celebi. You always know how to make the days longer."

Celebi (grinning): "Longer? Heh. I can make them endless if I want to."

They laughed together, unaware of the storms the future held.

-

[Scene 2 – The Titans Walk the Earth]
Time: Still in the flashback.
Location: Coastal City – Shadowed by Titans

Manaphy, prince of the sea, often walked with Meloetta near the shore. His playful nature faltered whenever the Regi Titans appeared, their towering forms silent, their gazes unknowable.

Manaphy (whispering, clutching Meloetta’s hand): "The way Regigigas stares… It’s as if he already knows something I don’t. I don’t like it."

Meloetta (softly, gripping his hand tighter): "Then look at me instead."

They didn’t know it yet, but Regigigas, obsessed with escaping mortality after his cosmic-scale scam collapse, was already spiraling.

-

[Scene 3 – The Fall of Arceus]
Time Jump: 4,101,000,892.3 years before previous spin-off's Chapter 100, 71.3 Years Before Saga 1
Location: Hidden Grove, Post-Arceus’ Death

The world shook with unholy news. Arceus was dead. Regigigas had done the impossible.

Hoopa (fuming): "We sealed the titans. Used Celebi’s time-lock tech. But..."

Mew (guiltily, looking away): "The seal’s backlash almost killed Manaphy. We didn’t mean..."

Celebi (staggered): "No. No, not him. Manaphy’s not a player in this game!"

Meloetta had no time to waste.
She found Manaphy, limp, barely breathing.

Meloetta (tears falling, holding him tightly): "Why… why did you get caught in this?"

Manaphy (weak smile): "If I must be trapped, let me be trapped like this… in your arms."

Meloetta: "There has to be a way. I won’t let this be the end."

Celebi (quietly): "There is. One jump. A one-way portal. Time… but it changes the jumper. You’ll be immortal. You may lose more than you gain."

Meloetta (without hesitation): "Open it."

Celebi (softly, almost pleading): "Are you sure?"

Meloetta: "Manaphy chose to stay in my arms. I’ll choose to stay with him forever."

They vanished into the wormhole.

[To Be Conitnued...]

Ch 2 : The Beginning of Carry Immortality Pt 2

[Scene 4 – The Birth of Bridal-Carry Immortality]
Time: About 11 Billion Years before previous spin-off's Chapter 100, 4.9 Billion Years Before Saga 1
Location: Erosbloom-89, Before Sentience Awakened

Meloetta awoke under pink skies. The air was raw and untouched.

Manaphy’s body remained motionless, but his voice still whispered. His face still smiled.

Manaphy (lightly): "Guess you’re stuck with me, huh?"

Meloetta (brushing his face, firm but kind): "Forever isn’t long enough."

The centuries passed. She built a machine, a massive, glimmering hourglass device. Its rules were strict:

- Bridal carry is the conduit.

- Both partners must accept the cost.

- Immortality comes with emotional gravity.

Meloetta carried Manaphy back to his watery cave after each experiment. He teased her about her obsession. She teased him about being dead weight.

But the comfort spread.

A few desperate couples came. Then more.
The first immortals bloomed quietly on this untouched world.

And Meloetta stayed by Manaphy’s side, always carrying him, always listening to his soft jokes across millennia.

-

[Scene 5 – The Telelink Realization]
Time: Still in the Distant Past, 11 billion years ago, Erosbloom-89

The centuries melted into millennia.

Meloetta noticed something.
Her created immortal couples, those who stepped into her bridal-carry hourglass machine, were different from her.

They couldn’t let go.

They were forever bound, not just by choice but by law of the machine.
Meloetta could still set Manaphy down.
She could walk freely.
Yet they were still connected, always.

So she crafted something new.
A Telelink.
A psychic thread, refined through her and Manaphy’s minds, that allowed distant couples to speak, even across worlds.

Manaphy once joked: "Guess you just didn’t want people yelling for you through wormholes anymore."

But Meloetta’s smile didn’t fade. : "If they’re desperate enough to call… I’ll catch them."

She had already built it, a subconscious wormhole catcher.
A net that would sense the rare, desperate cries of lovers who would rather cross time and space than be torn apart.

Over eons, she quietly became the cosmic comforter.
The one who gave them the chance she once fought to claim.

-

[Scene 6 – The Present Day, Evoir – The Watchers]
Time: Present Day
Location: Planet Evoir, Chronoscene Reflector Room

The memory faded.

The vision dissolved like mist.

Alolan Ninetales blinked, her fluffy tail draped lazily over the edge of the cliff they’d gathered on. Her ice shimmered under the setting sun.

Alolan Ninetales (softly, breaking the silence): "So… the bridal-carry immortality, the wormhole calls, the entire comfort system..."
She exhaled, her breath freezing in the air.
"...it all traces back to him. Regigigas. The absolute madman who set it all in motion."

Gardevoir (smiling faintly): "The mad godfather of immortality."

Flareon let out a quiet hum. Vaporeon, without a word, reached down, hoisting him into her arms with practiced ease.
She smirked. "Then we owe him our forever."

Lil Eve sat cross-legged, her head tilted as she pondered.
"But… it wasn’t supposed to be like this, right? It started as a scam, then became a war, then somehow turned into… comfort."

Keldeo crossed his arms, looking into the distance.
"Sometimes the cosmic joke has a punchline that still feels good."

Dragonvee adjusted her maid headband, then snugged Verdantvee closer in her arms.
"You know, Verdant… I wouldn’t be here without that maniac’s ripple effects."

Verdantvee (smiling softly):
"Yeah, me neither. I guess we’re all echoes of his disaster."

Divavee spun gently, bridal-carrying Boggyvee with her usual flair.
"A disaster that bloomed into something strangely… sweet."

Boggyvee (grinning): "The strongest comfort comes from the loudest falls, huh?"

They laughed, not loudly, just enough to breathe in the weight of it all.

-

[Scene 7 – Meanwhile… The Mad Godfather]
Location: Distant Planet, Mortill-Shim, Far from Evoir

Regigigas dusted his hands, the remains of a collapsed war settlement at his feet. He had just averted another planetary self-destruction.

Regigigas (to himself, almost bored): "Another one saved. Tch. These mortals still don’t know how to carry each other."

He gazed up, the echoes of bridal-carry bonds drifting faintly in his mind.

Regigigas (soft chuckle): "But some of them… some of them figured it out."

Without fanfare, without seeking thanks, he turned away. His journey wasn’t over.

Somewhere, someone else would be desperate enough to call.
And the cosmic comfort.
The impossible wormhole.
Would still answer.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Ch 3: TREE(3) Explained…

[Scene: Planet Mortill-Shim - Present day]

Regigigas had just wrapped up another planetary rescue.
Mortill-Shim was teetering on the edge of collapse, environmental disaster, civil war, the works. Regigigas stepped in, dragged the planet back from ruin, and now casually cruised the skies in his newly built spaceship, repurposed from his old tablet prison.

He wasn’t alone.
Two newly immortal passengers rode with him: Enefftian Bisharp, forever carrying his girlfriend, Enefftian Lilligant. They’d chosen to join his cosmic streaming journey, craving adventure beyond their world.

Inside the ship, Enefftian Lilligant clutched a worn-out flashback tape. She glanced at it, then at Regigigas.

“Gigas… can we… can we watch this? It’s about him.” She tightened her grip. “The Mortillian Pikachu. The rat. I… I need to understand.”

Enefftian Bisharp nodded firmly.
“Please. We just need to see where it all went wrong.”

Regigigas glanced at the tape, lazily spinning it in his massive hand. “You two really wanna dig up that rat’s story?”

“We do.” Bisharp said. “It’s… personal.”

“Alright. Don’t blame me if it’s disgusting.”
Regigigas slid the tape into the ship’s projector with a faint metallic click.

The screen flickered to life.

-

[Flashback: Mortill-Shim, One Year Ago]

Mortillian Pikachu (male, Electric/Dragon) wasn’t trying to survive.
He was trying to be the protagonist.

He bulldozed forests for resources, torched ancient woods with Thunder, and built an empire of shady paper businesses, all to fund his delusion of being the "wealthy main character."

No one questioned where his fortune came from. Until one day, a Mortillian Trevenant (male, Grass/Psychic) in a weathered police uniform finally traced the environmental collapse back to him.

Trevenant’s voice trembled through his communicator.
“I’ve found the source. It’s… it’s a Pikachu. He’s burning the forests himself.”

He called in backup: units of Mortillian Sudowoodo (Grass/Rock) and Mortillian Rotom (Electric/Psychic) converged on the scene.

Mortillian Pikachu didn’t hesitate.
With a wicked grin, he unleashed his power, overloading the forest with a brutal, crackling Thunderstorm.
The troops disintegrated in seconds. No remorse. No hesitation.

Trevenant staggered backward, overwhelmed.
“You… you’re killing your own planet…!”

Mortillian Pikachu pointed a finger at him, laughing.
“Side character. You’ll never understand. This is my story!”

Just as the fatal blow surged toward Trevenant, a Mortillian Goodra (female, Poison/Dragon) burst from the shadows, throwing herself in front of him and absorbing the electric blast.

“Run, Trevenant!” Goodra hissed, shielding him. “Get out of here!”

Mortillian Pikachu sneered.
“You’re all background noise.”

He fled toward the nearest city.
Within minutes, he unleashed a catastrophic power grid overload, a chain reaction that electrocuted millions of civilians, children among them.
The Mortillian military scrambled, but they were too late.
He hijacked a battleship and escaped into deep space, laughing as he vanished.

His last words echoed across the comms:
"I’ll be a main character with plot armor someday! You side characters can’t stop me!"

-

[Back to Present Time: Regigigas’ Ship]

The projector clicked off.

Silence.

Regigigas folded his arms, his stone-like shoulders grinding slightly as he shifted.
“I’ve done some stupid things in my time, but I’d never stoop as low as that rat.”

Enefftian Bisharp growled.
“He didn’t just kill people. He tried to steal your kind of immortality. Ours, too. But he never understood. He thought immortality would give him a story. He never saw it’s just… survival.”

Enefftian Lilligant sighed, leaning against Bisharp’s chest.
“Fate didn’t choose him. He shoved everyone else into the hourglass machine and thought he could rig it. But in the end, the machine chose.”

Regigigas clicked his tongue.
“Yeah. It chose to give him what he really deserved.”

-

[Scene: Erosbloom-89’s Moon Orbit]
Inside the death loop cosmic bubble, Mortillian Pikachu still wandered, still obsessed, still unrepentant. He stubbornly refused to grow, increasing his loop timer again and again, convinced he could wait it out.

But the system had grown tired of him.

It spawned a single Trevenant illusion with a fixed message:
“I will stab you TREE(3) times.”

The ARI ARI ARI ARI ARI stabbing began.
It still hasn’t stopped.

And it probably never will.

-

[Scene: Back on Mortill-Shim]

Regigigas shook his head slowly.
“Guy thought he could steal his way into our world. Tried to cheat the system. Ended up punching himself into an eternity.”

Bisharp nodded.
“A cosmic joke, huh?”

“A cosmic warning,” Regigigas muttered.
“Some rides, you don’t get off.”

-

[After a while in Mortill-Shim]

The ship gently cruised above Mortill-Shim, the skies clearing after Regigigas’ planetary save.
In the ship’s garden bay, Enefftian Lilligant sat comfortably in Enefftian Bisharp’s arms, his grip firm yet careful, like she belonged there forever.

Lilligant extended her palm toward the soil. Vines and saplings burst from the ground, rapidly accelerating the reforestation process as green waves danced across the ruined landscape.

Chat:
"SHE’S HEALING THE PLANET WHILE BEING HELD???"
"Bisharp’s got that hot carrier grip!"
"Marriage speedrun when?"

Regigigas, watching the stream, gave a casual thumbs up toward the camera.
“Plant it, queen.”

Lilligant giggled softly, glancing back at Bisharp.
“This is actually fun when you carry me like this.”

Bisharp smirked. “Then I’ll never put you down.”

The ship console blinked.

Incoming message: Alolan Ninetales
“Gigas, it’s me. I found something cursed about TREE(3). It’s… it’s connected to that rat’s death loop. You need to hear this.”

Regigigas perked up. “Ninetales? Call me on voice.”

“Better. I’ll switch to video.”

-

[Scene Transition: Evoir – Alolan Ninetales’ Observatory]

The live video feed flickered to life. Alolan Ninetales appeared, standing confidently in her sleek workspace on Evoir. Behind her floated a glowing holoboard filled with shifting mathematical graphs.

“Welcome to the unhinged part...” she teased.

She flipped to the TREE sequence chart.

“Let’s go over the basics...” Ninetales began, her tone playful but sharp.
“TREE(1) equals 1. It’s just a dot.”
She tapped to highlight the first diagram: a single vertex.
“TREE(2) equals 3. That’s as far as you can go with lines before running into forbidden configurations.”

She swiped again.

“But TREE(3)… it’s so big that even with immortality, it’s impossible to display it fully. Not even your spaceship’s storage could contain it.”

The holoboard rapidly sketched out the beginning of tree diagrams, fractal branches blooming into wild, random patterns.

“Why is this important?” she continued. “Let’s look at the parallel.”

She switched to a new holoboard showing geometric shape progression.

“One vertex? Just a dot.
Two vertices? Just a line.
Three vertices? Finally, a shape. A triangle.
Four vertices? Squares, rectangles.
Five? Pentagons.
Six? Hexagons.
And beyond.”

Ninetales twirled one of her tails as she smirked.
“Notice the pattern?”

Regigigas leaned forward, intrigued.
“Three vertices is the turning point. That’s when shapes start to exist.”

“Exactly.” She snapped her tails with satisfaction.
“That’s why TREE(3) explodes in complexity, it’s the minimum structure needed for infinite shape arrangements.
It’s not about numbers anymore. It’s about boundless possibilities.”

Regigigas chuckled. “No wonder the rat’s loop is called TREE(3). It’s a universe of punishment bound by infinite shape possibilities. Makes sense now why his stabbing never stops.”

Ninetales grinned.
“You ready to go deeper? Let’s touch TREE(4).”

She flipped to dimension charts.

“Zero-dimensional 0D: a dot.
One-dimensional 1D: a line.
Two-dimensional 2D: flat drawings, these live inside the scope of TREE(3)’s possible arrangements.
Three-dimensional 3D: physical space. Shapes now live in TREE(4)’s realm. The possibilities explode beyond the already incomprehensible TREE(3).”

The graphs visualized the leap from simple drawings to infinite 3D shape configurations.

“Now think about it...” she teased. “Switching from 2D drawings to 3D graphics? It’s basically diving into TREE(4) chaos.”

Regigigas banged his fist on the ship’s console, laughing.
“That’s a genius observation! The leap from 2D to 3D is mathematically reckless! No wonder half the official media can’t handle it!”

Ninetales giggled. “Yeah. It’s just as reckless as those Pikachus who thought they could hijack entire universes.”

Regigigas smirked. “Some rides never end. But at least now I know why that rat’s loop is the perfect punishment.”

Bisharp, still carrying Lilligant, glanced over.
“You think he’ll ever figure it out?”

Regigigas shrugged.
“If he does, the system will just find a bigger number.”

Ninetales winked.
“That’s the beauty of it. There’s always a bigger TREE.”
