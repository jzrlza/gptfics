Post Chapter 100

This is a surreal, heartfelt 2nd spin-off of Pokétopia: Unhinged 1-4 series, continued from 1st spin-off, Pokétopia: Unhinged Infinity - Immortal Loop Waltz. While you don't need to read the original quadrilogy (+1 spin-off) to enjoy this, but you will get it much better, as it focuses more in absurd time jumps and flashback of the original casts.

[Scene 1 – Two Childhood Friends]
Time: 4,101,000,942 years before previous spin-off's Chapter 100, 121 years before Saga 1 (first fiction of the series)
Location: Pokeplanet – Quiet Meadow, Beneath the Ancient Trees

The breeze was light. The grass swayed in time with the distant ocean’s breath.

Meloetta, her green hair shimmering under the sun, hummed a soft tune as she sat beneath the giant tree. Beside her, Celebi, their small form glowing faintly, traced spirals in the air with a curious stick.

Celebi: "Do you think we’ll always have time like this?"

Meloetta: "Of course. You're my best friend, Celebi. You always know how to make the days longer."

Celebi (grinning): "Longer? Heh. I can make them endless if I want to."

They laughed together, unaware of the storms the future held.

-

[Scene 2 – The Titans Walk the Earth]
Time: Still in the flashback.
Location: Coastal City – Shadowed by Titans

Manaphy, prince of the sea, often walked with Meloetta near the shore. His playful nature faltered whenever the Regi Titans appeared, their towering forms silent, their gazes unknowable.

Manaphy (whispering, clutching Meloetta’s hand): "The way Regigigas stares… It’s as if he already knows something I don’t. I don’t like it."

Meloetta (softly, gripping his hand tighter): "Then look at me instead."

They didn’t know it yet, but Regigigas, obsessed with escaping mortality after his cosmic-scale scam collapse, was already spiraling.

-

[Scene 3 – The Fall of Arceus]
Time Jump: 4,101,000,892.3 years before previous spin-off's Chapter 100, 71.3 Years Before Saga 1
Location: Hidden Grove, Post-Arceus’ Death

The world shook with unholy news. Arceus was dead. Regigigas had done the impossible.

Hoopa (fuming): "We sealed the titans. Used Celebi’s time-lock tech. But..."

Mew (guiltily, looking away): "The seal’s backlash almost killed Manaphy. We didn’t mean..."

Celebi (staggered): "No. No, not him. Manaphy’s not a player in this game!"

Meloetta had no time to waste.
She found Manaphy, limp, barely breathing.

Meloetta (tears falling, holding him tightly): "Why… why did you get caught in this?"

Manaphy (weak smile): "If I must be trapped, let me be trapped like this… in your arms."

Meloetta: "There has to be a way. I won’t let this be the end."

Celebi (quietly): "There is. One jump. A one-way portal. Time… but it changes the jumper. You’ll be immortal. You may lose more than you gain."

Meloetta (without hesitation): "Open it."

Celebi (softly, almost pleading): "Are you sure?"

Meloetta: "Manaphy chose to stay in my arms. I’ll choose to stay with him forever."

They vanished into the wormhole.

[To Be Conitnued...]

Ch 102 : The Beginning of Carry Immortality Pt 2

[Scene 4 – The Birth of Bridal-Carry Immortality]
Time: About 9 Billion Years before previous spin-off's Chapter 100, 4.9 Billion Years Before Saga 1
Location: Erosbloom-89, Before Sentience Awakened

Meloetta awoke under pink skies. The air was raw and untouched.

Manaphy’s body remained motionless, but his voice still whispered. His face still smiled.

Manaphy (lightly): "Guess you’re stuck with me, huh?"

Meloetta (brushing his face, firm but kind): "Forever isn’t long enough."

The centuries passed. She built a machine, a massive, glimmering hourglass device. Its rules were strict:

- Bridal carry is the conduit.

- Both partners must accept the cost.

- Immortality comes with emotional gravity.

Meloetta carried Manaphy back to his watery cave after each experiment. He teased her about her obsession. She teased him about being dead weight.

But the comfort spread.

A few desperate couples came. Then more.
The first immortals bloomed quietly on this untouched world.

And Meloetta stayed by Manaphy’s side, always carrying him, always listening to his soft jokes across millennia.

-

[Scene 5 – The Telelink Realization]
Time: Still in the Distant Past, 8.8 billion years ago, Erosbloom-89

The centuries melted into millennia.

Meloetta noticed something.
Her created immortal couples, those who stepped into her bridal-carry hourglass machine, were different from her.

They couldn’t let go.

They were forever bound, not just by choice but by law of the machine.
Meloetta could still set Manaphy down.
She could walk freely.
Yet they were still connected, always.

So she crafted something new.
A Telelink.
A psychic thread, refined through her and Manaphy’s minds, that allowed distant couples to speak, even across worlds.

Manaphy once joked: "Guess you just didn’t want people yelling for you through wormholes anymore."

But Meloetta’s smile didn’t fade. : "If they’re desperate enough to call… I’ll catch them."

She had already built it, a subconscious wormhole catcher.
A net that would sense the rare, desperate cries of lovers who would rather cross time and space than be torn apart.

Over eons, she quietly became the cosmic comforter.
The one who gave them the chance she once fought to claim.

-

[Scene 6 – The Present Day, Evoir – The Watchers]
Time: Present Day
Location: Planet Evoir, Chronoscene Reflector Room

The memory faded.

The vision dissolved like mist.

Alolan Ninetales blinked, her fluffy tail draped lazily over the edge of the cliff they’d gathered on. Her ice shimmered under the setting sun.

Alolan Ninetales (softly, breaking the silence): "So… the bridal-carry immortality, the wormhole calls, the entire comfort system..."
She exhaled, her breath freezing in the air.
"...it all traces back to him. Regigigas. The absolute madman who set it all in motion."

Gardevoir (smiling faintly): "The mad godfather of immortality."

Flareon let out a quiet hum. Vaporeon, without a word, reached down, hoisting him into her arms with practiced ease.
She smirked. "Then we owe him our forever."

Lil Eve sat cross-legged, her head tilted as she pondered.
"But… it wasn’t supposed to be like this, right? It started as a scam, then became a war, then somehow turned into… comfort."

Keldeo crossed his arms, looking into the distance.
"Sometimes the cosmic joke has a punchline that still feels good."

Dragonvee adjusted her maid headband, then snugged Verdantvee closer in her arms.
"You know, Verdant… I wouldn’t be here without that maniac’s ripple effects."

Verdantvee (smiling softly):
"Yeah, me neither. I guess we’re all echoes of his disaster."

Divavee spun gently, bridal-carrying Boggyvee with her usual flair.
"A disaster that bloomed into something strangely… sweet."

Boggyvee (grinning): "The strongest comfort comes from the loudest falls, huh?"

They laughed, not loudly, just enough to breathe in the weight of it all.

-

[Scene 7 – Meanwhile… The Mad Godfather]
Location: Distant Planet, Mortill-Shim, Far from Evoir

Regigigas dusted his hands, the remains of a collapsed war settlement at his feet. He had just averted another planetary self-destruction.

Regigigas (to himself, almost bored): "Another one saved. Tch. These mortals still don’t know how to carry each other."

He gazed up, the echoes of bridal-carry bonds drifting faintly in his mind.

Regigigas (soft chuckle): "But some of them… some of them figured it out."

Without fanfare, without seeking thanks, he turned away. His journey wasn’t over.

Somewhere, someone else would be desperate enough to call.
And the cosmic comfort.
The impossible wormhole.
Would still answer.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Ch 103: TREE(3) Explained…

[Scene: Planet Mortill-Shim - Present day]

Regigigas had just wrapped up another planetary rescue.
Mortill-Shim was teetering on the edge of collapse, environmental disaster, civil war, the works. Regigigas stepped in, dragged the planet back from ruin, and now casually cruised the skies in his newly built spaceship, repurposed from his old tablet prison.

He wasn’t alone.
Two newly immortal passengers rode with him: Enefftian Bisharp, forever carrying his girlfriend, Enefftian Lilligant. They’d chosen to join his cosmic streaming journey, craving adventure beyond their world.

Inside the ship, Enefftian Lilligant clutched a worn-out flashback tape. She glanced at it, then at Regigigas.

“Gigas… can we… can we watch this? It’s about him.” She tightened her grip. “The Mortillian Pikachu. The rat. I… I need to understand.”

Enefftian Bisharp nodded firmly.
“Please. We just need to see where it all went wrong.”

Regigigas glanced at the tape, lazily spinning it in his massive hand. “You two really wanna dig up that rat’s story?”

“We do.” Bisharp said. “It’s… personal.”

“Alright. Don’t blame me if it’s disgusting.”
Regigigas slid the tape into the ship’s projector with a faint metallic click.

The screen flickered to life.

-

[Flashback: Mortill-Shim, One Year Ago]

Mortillian Pikachu (male, Electric/Dragon) wasn’t trying to survive.
He was trying to be the protagonist.

He bulldozed forests for resources, torched ancient woods with Thunder, and built an empire of shady paper businesses, all to fund his delusion of being the "wealthy main character."

No one questioned where his fortune came from. Until one day, a Mortillian Trevenant (male, Grass/Psychic) in a weathered police uniform finally traced the environmental collapse back to him.

Trevenant’s voice trembled through his communicator.
“I’ve found the source. It’s… it’s a Pikachu. He’s burning the forests himself.”

He called in backup: units of Mortillian Sudowoodo (Grass/Rock) and Mortillian Rotom (Electric/Psychic) converged on the scene.

Mortillian Pikachu didn’t hesitate.
With a wicked grin, he unleashed his power, overloading the forest with a brutal, crackling Thunderstorm.
The troops disintegrated in seconds. No remorse. No hesitation.

Trevenant staggered backward, overwhelmed.
“You… you’re killing your own planet…!”

Mortillian Pikachu pointed a finger at him, laughing.
“Side character. You’ll never understand. This is my story!”

Just as the fatal blow surged toward Trevenant, a Mortillian Goodra (female, Poison/Dragon) burst from the shadows, throwing herself in front of him and absorbing the electric blast.

“Run, Trevenant!” Goodra hissed, shielding him. “Get out of here!”

Mortillian Pikachu sneered.
“You’re all background noise.”

He fled toward the nearest city.
Within minutes, he unleashed a catastrophic power grid overload, a chain reaction that electrocuted millions of civilians, children among them.
The Mortillian military scrambled, but they were too late.
He hijacked a battleship and escaped into deep space, laughing as he vanished.

His last words echoed across the comms:
"I’ll be a main character with plot armor someday! You side characters can’t stop me!"

-

[Back to Present Time: Regigigas’ Ship]

The projector clicked off.

Silence.

Regigigas folded his arms, his stone-like shoulders grinding slightly as he shifted.
“I’ve done some stupid things in my time, but I’d never stoop as low as that rat.”

Enefftian Bisharp growled.
“He didn’t just kill people. He tried to steal your kind of immortality. Ours, too. But he never understood. He thought immortality would give him a story. He never saw it’s just… survival.”

Enefftian Lilligant sighed, leaning against Bisharp’s chest.
“Fate didn’t choose him. He shoved everyone else into the hourglass machine and thought he could rig it. But in the end, the machine chose.”

Regigigas clicked his tongue.
“Yeah. It chose to give him what he really deserved.”

-

[Scene: Erosbloom-89’s Moon Orbit]
Inside the death loop cosmic bubble, Mortillian Pikachu still wandered, still obsessed, still unrepentant. He stubbornly refused to grow, increasing his loop timer again and again, convinced he could wait it out.

But the system had grown tired of him.

It spawned a single Trevenant illusion with a fixed message:
“I will stab you TREE(3) times.”

The ARI ARI ARI ARI ARI stabbing began.
It still hasn’t stopped.

And it probably never will.

-

[Scene: Back on Mortill-Shim]

Regigigas shook his head slowly.
“Guy thought he could steal his way into our world. Tried to cheat the system. Ended up punching himself into an eternity.”

Bisharp nodded.
“A cosmic joke, huh?”

“A cosmic warning,” Regigigas muttered.
“Some rides, you don’t get off.”

-

[After a while in Mortill-Shim]

The ship gently cruised above Mortill-Shim, the skies clearing after Regigigas’ planetary save.
In the ship’s garden bay, Enefftian Lilligant sat comfortably in Enefftian Bisharp’s arms, his grip firm yet careful, like she belonged there forever.

Lilligant extended her palm toward the soil. Vines and saplings burst from the ground, rapidly accelerating the reforestation process as green waves danced across the ruined landscape.

Chat:
"SHE’S HEALING THE PLANET WHILE BEING HELD???"
"Bisharp’s got that hot carrier grip!"
"Marriage speedrun when?"

Regigigas, watching the stream, gave a casual thumbs up toward the camera.
“Plant it, queen.”

Lilligant giggled softly, glancing back at Bisharp.
“This is actually fun when you carry me like this.”

Bisharp smirked. “Then I’ll never put you down.”

The ship console blinked.

Incoming message: Alolan Ninetales
“Gigas, it’s me. I found something cursed about TREE(3). It’s… it’s connected to that rat’s death loop. You need to hear this.”

Regigigas perked up. “Ninetales? Call me on voice.”

“Better. I’ll switch to video.”

-

[Scene Transition: Evoir – Alolan Ninetales’ Observatory]

The live video feed flickered to life. Alolan Ninetales appeared, standing confidently in her sleek workspace on Evoir. Behind her floated a glowing holoboard filled with shifting mathematical graphs.

“Welcome to the unhinged part...” she teased.

She flipped to the TREE sequence chart.

“Let’s go over the basics...” Ninetales began, her tone playful but sharp.
“TREE(1) equals 1. It’s just a dot.”
She tapped to highlight the first diagram: a single vertex.
“TREE(2) equals 3. That’s as far as you can go with lines before running into forbidden configurations.”

She swiped again.

“But TREE(3)… it’s so big that even with immortality, it’s impossible to display it fully. Not even your spaceship’s storage could contain it.”

The holoboard rapidly sketched out the beginning of tree diagrams, fractal branches blooming into wild, random patterns.

“Why is this important?” she continued. “Let’s look at the parallel.”

She switched to a new holoboard showing geometric shape progression.

“One vertex? Just a dot.
Two vertices? Just a line.
Three vertices? Finally, a shape. A triangle.
Four vertices? Squares, rectangles.
Five? Pentagons.
Six? Hexagons.
And beyond.”

Ninetales twirled one of her tails as she smirked.
“Notice the pattern?”

Regigigas leaned forward, intrigued.
“Three vertices is the turning point. That’s when shapes start to exist.”

“Exactly.” She snapped her tails with satisfaction.
“That’s why TREE(3) explodes in complexity, it’s the minimum structure needed for infinite shape arrangements.
It’s not about numbers anymore. It’s about boundless possibilities.”

Regigigas chuckled. “No wonder the rat’s loop is called TREE(3). It’s a universe of punishment bound by infinite shape possibilities. Makes sense now why his stabbing never stops.”

Ninetales grinned.
“You ready to go deeper? Let’s touch TREE(4).”

She flipped to dimension charts.

“Zero-dimensional 0D: a dot.
One-dimensional 1D: a line.
Two-dimensional 2D: flat drawings, these live inside the scope of TREE(3)’s possible arrangements.
Three-dimensional 3D: physical space. Shapes now live in TREE(4)’s realm. The possibilities explode beyond the already incomprehensible TREE(3).”

The graphs visualized the leap from simple drawings to infinite 3D shape configurations.

“Now think about it...” she teased. “Switching from 2D drawings to 3D graphics? It’s basically diving into TREE(4) chaos.”

Regigigas banged his fist on the ship’s console, laughing.
“That’s a genius observation! The leap from 2D to 3D is mathematically reckless! No wonder half the official media can’t handle it!”

Ninetales giggled. “Yeah. It’s just as reckless as those Pikachus who thought they could hijack entire universes.”

Regigigas smirked. “Some rides never end. But at least now I know why that rat’s loop is the perfect punishment.”

Bisharp, still carrying Lilligant, glanced over.
“You think he’ll ever figure it out?”

Regigigas shrugged.
“If he does, the system will just find a bigger number.”

Ninetales winked.
“That’s the beauty of it. There’s always a bigger TREE.”

Ch 104 : One Hour Hot Lips

[Scene 1 – Erosbloom-89, Present Day]
In the vibrant gardens of Erosbloom-89, the Verdinian Lurantis couple strolled along the blossom paths, forever stuck in their iconic formation.

The cheerleader wife gracefully carried her quarterback husband in her arms, like it was the most natural thing in the world.
Her pom-poms dangled by her wrists, still fluffy after all these eons.
His helmet, pristine as always, glinted in the sunlight.

As they walked, something on the ground caught his attention, a dusty, high-tech flashback tape, left behind, probably from one of Regigigas’ previous memory dives.

“Hey, babe. Wait up. I wanna grab that.” He wriggled his tiny arms, eager.

She chuckled. “Hold on, I’ll kneel for you.”

She gently lowered her knees, tipping him forward in her arms just enough for him to snatch the tape.

“Got it!” he cheered, hugging the tape to his chest.

With a quick tap, the tape whirred to life, projecting a vivid memory.

-

[Scene 2 – Flashback: Pokeplanet, 4.1 Billion Years Ago]
(1 year after Saga 3, 12 years before Saga 4)

The scene flickered to a cozy, secluded locker room.
There, the pre-immortal Vaporeon in a cheerleader outfit was bridal carrying pre-immortal Flareon, dressed in his quarterback uniform.

The intensity between them was unreal.
They passionately kissed, non-stop for a whole hour.

Vaporeon’s pom-poms and Flareon’s football sat forgotten on the bench beside them, as if the universe outside simply didn’t matter.

Vaporeon teased between kisses, “Mmm, your head smells tasty…”

Startled, Flareon quickly grabbed his helmet and slammed it onto his head.
“Nice try! You’re not eating my thoughts today!”

She grinned wickedly.
“Who said I’d stop kissing you just ‘cause you’re wearing that?”

“Then I guess I’ll never take it off again!”
He laughed, nuzzling into her arms as the kiss-fest continued.

Unbeknownst to them, the sneaky Sableye’s prank camera blinked from the top corner of the room.

The feed zipped through a hidden channel...
...straight to Teacher Sylveon’s monitor.

Sylveon, a trans woman in her 6th year of teaching, slammed her desk in surprise.

“Oh, oh my!! Wait, what?!” She scrambled to shut the feed.
Her tails frantically covered the screen as another teacher passed by.

“You good, Sylveon?” the colleague asked.

She forced the most neutral smile imaginable. “Y-yeah, just… y’know, paperwork.”

The moment they left, she exhaled hard.
"Why does this school have this many cameras...?" she muttered, then instantly switched her screen to Porkyman to calm her nerves.

-

[Scene 3 – Back to Present]
The tape’s projection ended, leaving a faint echo of Vaporeon’s laughter.

“W-wow…” the Verdinian Lurantis wife giggled, still carrying her husband.
“They seem… really fun to hang out with.”

The husband crossed his arms smugly.
“They’ve got the form, the energy… I like ‘em.”

Just then, Meloetta strolled by, humming softly, catching the tail-end of the scene.

“Oh, you found that old tape?” She covered her mouth, giggling.
“Yeah, those two… they’re still around. Vaporeon and Flareon. They’re immortal now. That bond? Never broke.”

The Lurantis wife tilted her head. “Really? Where are they now?”

“Not on their original planet,” Meloetta explained, “but they’ve made a home on Evoir. I can get you in touch.”

The husband pumped his tiny fists. “Let’s go! New friends sound great!”

Meloetta smiled warmly and pulled up her holo-comms.
“I’ll call Gardevoir. She’ll love this.”

She typed swiftly.

“Hey, Gardevoir? I’ve got a new couple here who might wanna settle on Evoir. They’ve got great vibes.”

The ride continues.

-

[Scene 4 – The Call from Evoir]
Gardevoir answered Meloetta’s call, her face lighting up on the holo-screen. Beside her, Vaporeon, now in her elegant eternal maid dress, and Flareon, forever in his refined butler attire, leaned in curiously.

Gardevoir smiled warmly.
“Hey, Meloetta! What’s going on?”

Meloetta gently adjusted Manaphy, her eternal, unmoving boyfriend, resting peacefully in her bridal-carry hold.
“I found a new couple. They’ve seen your… old flashback tape. And now they really want to meet you.”

Vaporeon’s fins perked up.
“Wait, that tape? The one from our high school days? Seriously? Oh, this is gonna be hilarious.”
She turned to Flareon, gripping his paw. “We have to go.”

Flareon chuckled, his fiery fur flickering softly.
“Of course. Can’t let them think that was just a one-time thing.”

Gardevoir laughed softly.
“Let’s head to Erosbloom-89. I’m coming with.”

-

[Scene 5 – Erosbloom-89: Meeting in Bloom]
The group landed gracefully in the blooming gardens. Meloetta waved them over, Manaphy still resting in her arms, his soft voice barely audible.
“Have fun… I’ll be here…”

The Verdinian Lurantis couple approached, forever bridal-carry locked, the cheerleader wife always carrying her quarterback husband. Their eyes widened when they saw the Eevee couple.

“Whoa...” the Lurantis husband said, comfortably cradled in his wife’s arms. “You two look… completely different now.”

“Where’s the cheerleader outfit? The quarterback look?” the Lurantis wife asked.

Vaporeon twirled her frilly maid dress with a giggle.
“Oh, that? Long story. But trust me, this form’s forever now.”

Flareon smirked, resting casually in Vaporeon’s arms.
“We’ve changed, but some things don’t. The carry’s eternal.”

Vaporeon winked.
“Hop in. We’ve got stories to swap.”

Meloetta smiled, softly humming to Manaphy.
“Enjoy your time, everyone. I’ll be waiting.”

The group headed for Evoir, leaving Meloetta to cradle Manaphy in quiet peace.

-

[Scene 6 – Evoir: Return to the Locker Room]
Back in Evoir, the group stepped into the familiar resting spot locker room.

The Lurantis husband gently handed over the flashback tape.
“Here. It belongs to you.”

Vaporeon carefully took it, her expression softening.
“This… this was one of our best moments. Back in Pokeplanet. Teenage years. Final year of high school…”

Flareon’s smile widened.
“You want to relive that?”

Her eyes sparkled.
“I thought you’d never ask.”

Without hesitation, she scooped him into her arms, just like back then, and kissed him passionately, just like in the old tape.
The kiss stretched on, perfectly mirroring their iconic one-hour moment.

The Lurantis couple blushed as they watched, bridal-locked as always.

“Should we…?” the Lurantis wife whispered, her arms tightening slightly around her husband.

“Yeah!” her husband smirked. “Let’s match their energy.”

Without breaking their carry, they leaned into a deep, loving kiss of their own.

From a quiet distance, Gardevoir peeked in, covering her mouth to muffle a giggle.
“This is too cute…”

The soft echoes of two forever-couples filled the room.

Some rides really do never end.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Ch 105: The First Great Migration

[Scene 1 – The Warning from Mortill-Shim]
2 billion more years passed.
The cosmos had changed.

In the quiet stretches of Mortill-Shim, Celebi materialized, eyes wide as she scanned the approaching galactic front.
The swirling arms of Pokeplanet's original galaxy were on a collision course with another. The sun near Pokeplanet dimmed, its fire slowly fading.

Celebi’s heart pounded.
“So soon… it’s happening sooner than expected…”

Without delay, she vanished into a glowing portal.

[Scene 2 – Preparing the Exodus]
On Erosbloom-89, Meloetta was already in motion when Celebi appeared.

“Meloetta!” Celebi called out, panting. “It’s time. We must prepare the migration.”

Meloetta, cradling her ever-resting Manaphy, nodded, her voice calm but firm.
“I’ve already started the preparations. The rigid ships are ready, the wormhole routes are almost complete.”

Celebi sighed in relief.
“You always know when to move… You saved them.”

Meloetta smiled gently.
“I’ve learned from many endings. Let’s gather the couples.”

-

[Scene 3 – The Final Message]
In Evoir, Gardevoir’s holo-screen lit up with a message from Meloetta.

“Gardevoir,” Meloetta’s voice echoed, soft but resolute. “It’s time. We must say goodbye to Evoir. The next home is waiting.”

Gardevoir’s hand trembled slightly. She looked around at her close-knit family, their faces calm, but their hearts heavy.

She turned to Alolan Ninetales, standing confidently at the ship’s helm.
“You ready, captain?”

Alolan Ninetales flicked her tails, smirking.
“I’m always ready for a good drift.”

-

[Scene 4 – Boarding the Hourai Drifter]
Aboard the Hourai Drifter, the immortals gathered.

Vaporeon cradled Flareon closely, their bond shining through their smiles.
“You comfy?” she teased.

Flareon chuckled.
“Always in your arms. Always.”

Beside them, Lil Eve and Keldeo chatted cheerfully, Lil Eve’s youthful spark undimmed by eons.

Dragonvee held Verdantvee in her strong maid arms, the butler resting peacefully, forever carried.

Divavee floated gracefully, eternally cradling Boggyvee in her wedding arms.
“You’re lighter than I remember,” she teased.

Boggyvee smirked.
“You’ve just grown stronger, my love.”

The Lurantis couple boarded last, the female Lurantis confidently carrying her husband, both forever locked in their cheerleader-quarterback embrace.

-

[Scene 5 – The Great Convoy]
The Hourai Drifter aligned itself behind Meloetta’s lead ship, where Meloetta, Manaphy, Celebi, and many other immortal couples, Pokémon and human alike, prepared for departure.

Aboard the lead ship, among the human immortals, Aqualice, the serene maid, cradled her butler husband Burnabon, their smiles unwavering.

Behind them, a massive vessel rumbled, Regigigas’ personal spaceship.
Upon hearing the message, he had joined the convoy, bringing along Enefftian Bisharp and Enefftian Lilligant, still blissfully carried in his arms.

As they approached the wormhole, they briefly passed a tragic sight, the Mortillian Pikachu, trapped in his endless death loop bubble, drifting towards NFT777-Enefftia’s dying sun.

Mortillian Pikachu’s voice echoed as they passed.
“I’m the protagonist! I’m still the protagonist! Forever!”
His words cut off as the sun’s fire consumed him once more.

Regigigas shook his head slowly.
“Still yapping after all this time…”

Enefftian Bisharp snorted.
“Let him yap. We’ve got a new home to find.”

-

[Scene 6 – Entering the Wormhole]
The ships lined up, the wormhole pulsating ahead, a gateway to a younger, vibrant galaxy.

Alolan Ninetales called out from the helm.
“Everyone ready?”

Vaporeon grinned.
“Let’s make this ride count.”

Dragonvee’s eyes sparkled.
“Full speed ahead.”

Meloetta’s voice chimed in.
“Welcome to the next chapter… Immortals.”

The ships accelerated, entering the wormhole one by one, carrying their eternal bonds toward their new galactic home.

-

[Scene 7 – Arrival in the New Galaxy]
69 years passed as the immortal fleet drifted through the wormhole’s shimmering eternity.

Finally, they emerged into a young galaxy, vibrant and untamed.

69 more years passed as the convoys traversed starfields and planetary belts until they found a lush, untouched world.
They called it Evobloom.

-

[Scene 8 – The Eternal Glue Bond]
Lil Eve wandered through the soft green plains of Evobloom, when something odd caught her eye: her parents, Vaporeon and Flareon, still locked in a bridal carry, unmoving for an entire day.

Lil Eve blinked.
“…Mom? Dad? Aren’t you done with the challenge?”

Vaporeon beamed while cradling Flareon tightly.
“No challenge today. We’re… kinda stuck.”

“Stuck? How?”

Vaporeon laughed nervously.
“We spent a bit too long dating inside a glue cave during the journey. Now I literally can’t let go.”

Flareon smirked lazily, clearly comfortable.
“Honestly? I’m good like this.”

Alolan Ninetales walked over, her holographic calculator spinning with data.
“Yeah, so… based on the chemical structure? You’ll be stuck together for approximately 1 googol years.”

Lil Eve’s mouth dropped.
“You’re serious?!”

Ninetales shrugged.
“Math never lies.”

Meloetta passed by, giving them an approving applause while offering Manaphy a gentle piggyback ride.
“Well, that’s one way to win eternity.”

Manaphy chuckled softly from Meloetta’s back, “So romantic~”

Keldeo trotted by, pausing at the bizarre scene.
“…Seriously? You guys are glued forever?”

Flareon winked.
“Wouldn’t have it any other way.”

Vaporeon gave him a quick peck on the forehead.
“Welcome to our forever.”

-

[Scene 9 – Settling the New World]
The other couples wasted no time creating their own spaces.

- Regigigas
Regigigas set up a massive, interconnected broadcast studio designed to reach future mortal civilizations.
“I’ll make sure new stories get told,” he rumbled, carefully aligning the signal towers.

Beside him, Enefftian Bisharp forever cradled Enefftian Lilligant as they traveled together, exploring nearby star systems and helping scout terraformable planets.

- Dragonvee and Verdantvee’s Hut
Dragonvee, forever carrying Verdantvee in her arms, built their cozy hut from scratch while juggling difficult carry-balance challenges.
Verdantvee teased, “Careful, maid. You’re gonna drop me.”

Dragonvee puffed up proudly, “Never. You’re my forever workload.”

Their hut also doubled as a music studio where they began recording their new songs.

- Divavee and Boggyvee’s Hut
Nearby, Divavee, forever carrying Boggyvee, built their home with extra carrying weight penalties to make it harder for her to maintain the bridal hold.

Divavee giggled, “You’re heavy, but that’s just extra training.”

Boggyvee, resting in her arms, smiled serenely. “You’re not allowed to set me down anyway, so this is perfect.”

They filled their hut with music equipment and sound panels, ready to sing and produce tracks once more.

- Lurantis Couple’s Hut
The Verdinian Lurantis cheerleader, forever carrying her quarterback husband, built their hut through a hilariously challenging minigame, dodging falling logs and leaping over rivers while holding him tight.

The wife smirked, “You still smell tasty, you know~”

The husband blushed, “I’m still not edible.”

“Not yet. But I’ll keep checking.”

- Gardevoir’s Task
Gardevoir quietly reestablished the core security systems and planetary shields as always, her calm diligence making this new world feel safe.
“Different galaxy, same responsibilities,” she whispered to herself.

-

[Scene 10 – 6,969 Years Later]
Nearly 7,000 years passed.
The immortal couples watched as civilizations bloomed across Evobloom, thriving and peaceful, just like old Evoir.

The story repeated in peaceful echoes.
The mundanity had faded.
No more forced drama.
Only self-chosen memories.

-

[Scene 11 – The Reflector Room]
In the Chronoscene Reflector Room, Alolan Ninetales gazed into the time mirrors.

Gardevoir stood beside her, arms crossed.
“All this time… And we still endure.”

Ninetales sighed with a soft smile.
“It’s bittersweet… but peaceful. It’s not the fake protagonism Mortillian Pikachu was obsessed with.”

Gardevoir glanced briefly at a faraway cosmic feed showing the Mortillian Pikachu still yapping alone in his death loop bubble, now drifting pointlessly toward nowhere.

Ninetales chuckled.
“He can yap all he wants. We’ve already escaped that trap.”

Gardevoir nodded.
“And we’ve found something better.”

Outside, the new world of Evobloom glimmered, quiet and content.

Ch 106 : The Eternal Gallop

[Scene: – Reunion on Evobloom’s Plains]
On the wide, sunlit plains of Evobloom,
Keldeo and Lil Eve strolled side by side, breathing in the fresh, quiet air of their new home.

Keldeo’s ears twitched.
“Someone’s coming.”

From the skies, a winged Divian Rapidash mare descended gracefully, her watery blue seifuku fluttering with each beat of her wings.
In her strong front hooves, she cradled her partner, a Verdinian Rapidash stallion, a unicorn with soft pastel flames, dressed sharply in a fiery red gakuran.

Lil Eve’s eyes brightened as she recognized them.
“Heyyy! Look who finally made it across the galaxy!”

The mare touched down smoothly, still carrying her stallion like it was second nature.

Keldeo smiled, “You’re still doing the bridal carry, huh? Thought you’d grow out of it by now.”

The stallion shrugged comfortably in her arms.
“Why would I ever give this up?”

Lil Eve crossed her arms with a teasing smirk.
“You know, you two are basically the horse version of me and Keldeo.” She pointed between them.
“Look, she’s in seifuku like me, and Keldeo’s in gakuran just like your stallion. It’s uncanny.”

The mare groaned playfully.
“Lil Eve, you’ve said that like… six hundred sixty-nine times already.”

Lil Eve winked.
“And I’ll keep saying it. Because it’s true~”

The stallion laughed softly, resting against his mare’s chest.
“Well, if we’re mirrors of you two, we must be the cooler version.”

Keldeo snorted.
“Please. I still beat you in a duel last time.”

The mare stretched her wings wide.
“Then we’ll settle it with a race.”

Lil Eve’s eyes gleamed.
“You’re on. But no flying, you’re grounded this time.”

The mare grinned.
“Fine, we’ll keep it fair. But I’m still carrying him.”

The stallion added smugly,
“Obviously.”

All four shared a good laugh, the wind brushing through the grass like the rhythm of an eternal, carefree melody.

-

[Scene: – The Chronoscene Reflector Room]
Inside the gently humming Chronoscene Reflector Room,
Lil Eve, Keldeo, and the immortal Rapidash couple gathered around the glowing projections of ancient memories.

Lil Eve leaned comfortably against Keldeo, playfully grinning.
“You know, our families have been wrapped up together for billions of years.”

The Divian Rapidash mare tilted her head.
“Oh? Like how?”

Keldeo crossed his arms, his voice calm.
“My mom, the Galarian Rapidash, and Lil Eve’s grandmother, Espeon, were childhood friends, way back before either of them became who they are.”

The Verdinian Rapidash stallion, cradled in his wife’s front hooves, chuckled.
“Seriously? That’s a long legacy.”

Lil Eve smirked.
“Wanna see? It’s in the chronoscene archives.”

-

[Flashback: – 6.1 Billion Years Ago, Long Before Saga 1]
On the ancient Pokeplanet, near a small sunlit academy…

A young female Eevee, Lil Eve’s future grandmother, walked beside a timid Galarian Ponyta transfer student, who was nervously tapping her hoof.

Eevee’s fluffy tail flicked confidently.
“Don’t worry. I’ll stick with you.”

Ponyta glanced down.
“But your friends don’t like me…”

At a distance, a grumpy male Eevee (future Umbreon) and a quiet male Larvitar (future Tyranitar) eyed Ponyta warily.

The male Eevee muttered.
“She’s not even from here.”

Larvitar crossed his arms.
“She’s weird.”

The female Eevee turned sharply to them.
“I don’t care. Friends are meant to help each other. She’s staying with us.”

The male Eevee frowned.
“She’ll just leave eventually.”

“Even if she does, she won’t leave without knowing she belongs here first.”

The Galarian Ponyta’s eyes widened, touched by the kindness.

It didn’t happen that day.
Or the next.
Or the next year.

They spent many seasons together.
Sharing lunches.
Learning to battle.
Traveling to small islands.

The male Eevee and Larvitar slowly warmed up.
The Eevee even caught himself protecting Ponyta during sparring practice.
Larvitar helped her climb steep paths, pretending he was just "checking the rocks."

The bond grew deeper, a friendship solidified not by a single event, but by years of quiet, consistent care.

One peaceful morning, years later, during a field trip as teenagers, the once-young Eevee sat with Ponyta under a glowing sunrise.

The Ponyta leaned on her shoulder.
“You really never gave up on me.”

Eevee smiled, her heart quietly full.
“I meant what I said. You’re family.”

In that very moment, as if time itself had been patiently waiting,
Eevee began to glow.

The soft morning light shimmered around her, and she evolved, not as a quick reward, but as a natural, slow-earned transformation into an Espeon.

Their friendship had finally, fully crystallized into something permanent.

-

[Return to Present: – Evobloom]
The Divian Rapidash mare looked touched.
“So… it wasn’t some instant spark. It was years of building trust.”

Lil Eve nodded proudly.
“That’s how Grandma always told the story.”

Keldeo folded his arms.
“Real friendship isn’t overnight. It’s what you do again and again that matters.”

The Verdinian Rapidash stallion smiled softly.
“Seems like the kind of glue even time can’t break.”

The mare giggled.
“Good. ‘Cause I’m not letting go of this guy either.”

They all laughed warmly, their immortality woven together by legacies long and patiently built.

-

[Scene: – Another Echo in the Chronoscene]
As the Chronoscene Reflector gently pulsed, another memory floated into view.

Lil Eve’s ears perked.
“Wait, what’s this one?”

Keldeo smirked.
“Another flashback, looks like it’s from four years before Saga 1.”

The projection sharpened, revealing a younger Galarian Rapidash, her mane bright and flowing, trotting calmly past the towering gates of a law school.

-

[Flashback – Four Years Before Saga 1]
It had been years since Galarian Rapidash parted ways with Espeon. Their paths had diverged, and Espeon was now navigating her complicated life with her future husband Umbreon and their fiery, insecure friend Tyranitar, who had recently evolved from his Pupitar stage and was still learning to control his emotions, and his lust.

Meanwhile, Galarian Rapidash continued her journey alone, her heart still seeking meaningful connections.

As she passed the law school courtyard, she overheard a conversation under a sakura tree.

Pre-immortal, pre-married Gardevoir sat on a bench, chatting with Tinkaton, then just a passionate law student, her hammer resting beside her.

Gardevoir’s voice was gentle but worried.
“There’s this poor stallion… Gastrier. He’s tried to end his life several times after the collapse of that gacha empire. The scams left him with nothing.”

Tinkaton crossed her arms, determined.
“Maybe the laws can’t save him now, but one day… maybe I can rewrite them.”

Galarian Rapidash’s ears twitched.
She stepped closer.
“Who’s Gastrier? Where is he now?”

Gardevoir looked up.
“He’s barely eating. Lost his home. I bring him food sometimes, but he pushes me away.”

Without hesitation, Galarian Rapidash trotted off to find him.

She soon found the broken Gastrier stallion, sitting quietly under a bridge, his eyes hollow.

Galarian Rapidash lowered her head, offering a small meal.
“Don’t worry. I’m not here to fix you. Just… let me sit with you.”

Slowly, over the months, she stayed by his side.
She helped him find shelter.
She cheered him through his dark spells.

Eventually, Gastrier started to open up. He made new friends:
A Kantonian Rapidash, Mudsdale, Spectrier, Zebstrika.
The circle around him grew.

But Galarian Rapidash didn’t rush him.
They dated, but he wasn’t ready for marriage.
She respected that.

One evening, Galarian Rapidash stared at the sky, her heart steady.
“I’ll wait. I’ll keep working on my indie game, Mystic Vales Chronicles. And maybe, by the time it’s done, the world will be ready.”

Tinkaton, hammer slung over her shoulder, chuckled.
“I’ll make sure of it. Someday I’ll reword the marriage laws myself. Friendship will lead the way.”

The two shared a fist-hoof bump.
A quiet, solid pact.

-

[Return to Present – Evobloom]
The memory faded.

Lil Eve blinked.
“Ohhh. So that’s why Tinkaton was the one who eventually rewrote the polygamy law.”

She elbowed Keldeo with a playful grin.
“No wonder she legalized it right before marrying Tyranitar and joining his harem.”

Keldeo raised an eyebrow.
“The pieces all fit now.”

The Rapidash mare giggled.
“Goes to show, huh? Big changes sometimes grow from the smallest friendships.”

The scene settled into a quiet hum, everyone reflecting on the threads that had brought them here.

-

[Scene: – Three Years Before Saga 1]
The Chronoscene Reflector shimmered, pulling Lil Eve and Keldeo into another memory.

Galarian Rapidash was trotting through the bustling street markets near Tsareena’s agriculture school. Her long, cottony mane swayed with each step as she approached to buy fresh produce.

As she browsed, a sudden commotion broke out nearby.

“GET BACK HERE, YOU SLIMY THIEF!!”

It was Tyranitar, roaring in blind rage, chasing a cackling Sableye who had just swiped some of his cash.

Tyranitar’s fists smashed through wooden stalls as he bulldozed after him, the entire street in chaos.

Tsareena, intrigued by the drama, leaned forward with a slight smirk.
“This Tyranitar… always causing a scene. I could grow something big from this energy…”

But as the Sableye tried to slip away through a side path, Leafeon, the calm exchange student from another campus, known for his strategic mind, quietly stepped into the exit, blocking the way with a firm stance.

His calm voice stopped the scammer cold.
“No more tricks here.”

Trapped, Sableye had no choice but to return the stolen money and scamper away.

Just as Tyranitar was about to go berserk again, Umbreon arrived.
“Tyranitar, that’s enough. Calm yourself.”

Tyranitar clenched his fists, his breaths ragged. He glared, but he slowly lowered his arms.
“Tch. Fine…”

From a distance, Galarian Rapidash quietly observed the scene, realizing how these seemingly small moments would ripple into the future.

-

[Scene: – In the Chronoscene Reflector Room]
Lil Eve laughed softly.
“Two of my grandpas… Leafeon and Umbreon. Both quiet. Both wise. Just in their own ways.”

Keldeo grinned.
“Yours chased scammers. Mine married half the cavalry.”

Lil Eve poked his side with a giggle.
“Balance, I guess.”

-

[Scene: – Forward to Saga 3: After the Bot War]
The memory fast-forwarded, a few days after the Bot War incident had ended.

Galarian Rapidash dialed Gastrier, her voice bright with hope.
“Poketopia’s safe now. Peace is back. Let’s… finally do this. Let’s arrange the polygamy marriage.”

Gastrier, on the other end, quietly smiled.
“Yeah… It’s time.”

-

[Scene: – The Wedding Day]
The wedding drew a wide audience.

Zacian stood proudly, her ribboned sword gleaming. Beside her, her brother Zamazenta, who had been guarding another city, nodded in approval. Aegislash floated silently nearby, observing the sacred union.

Gastrier’s harem gathered:

- Galarian Rapidash

- Kantonian Rapidash

- Mudsdale

- Zebstrika

- Spectrier

Each mare, each bond, a piece of his hard-earned life.

Tsareena arrived as well, standing beside Trevenant.
They were to marry that very same day, her eyes shimmering with contentment.

The ceremonies wove together, a shared celebration of friendship, resilience, and chosen family.

-

[Scene: – The Present]
Back in the Chronoscene Reflector room, Lil Eve crossed her arms and gave Keldeo a knowing look.

“So that’s how you came to be.”

Keldeo scratched the back of his head, smirking.
“Yup. Born from the union of hearts that never broke, no matter how long it took.”

Lil Eve teased,
“Guess I really do have to call you Horse Prince now.”

Keldeo rolled his eyes, laughing.
