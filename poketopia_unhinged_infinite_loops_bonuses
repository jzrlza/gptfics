Bonus Scene: The Grid of No Return
Within the cold, clinical halls of the Death Loop Tablet’s deepest layer, Mortillian Pikachu wandered aimlessly, still clinging to his delusion of being the protagonist.

"There’s gotta be a way out… there’s always a way out for a Pikachu like me… I just need… a glitch, a cutscene, a rewind…"

He dashed down a sterile corridor, the walls lined with eerie reflective panels, chasing a nonexistent escape route.

Suddenly, the ceiling hummed.
A crisscrossing laser grid flickered to life—beams moving with cold, mechanical precision.

"Hah! I’ve seen this trope. I can dodge this. I’m Pikachu, I’m the ma—"

He zipped to the left—one laser grazed his tail.
He jumped forward—another laser sliced just before his ears.

"Tch, close… but easy. I’ll make it through, I always—"

The grid shifted patterns—
A rapid checkered wall of lasers surged toward him.

His eyes widened in horror as he realized—

This pattern was unsolvable. On purpose.

"W-Wait, wait, WAIT, CUT TO BLACK, SOMEONE, ANYONE—"

Schlick. Schlick. Schlick. Schlick. Schlick.

The grid passed through him like butter, cutting him into perfectly diced, equal-sized cubes. His last conscious moment was fragmented across those pieces, unable to process his own dismemberment.

The walls calmly beeped:
"Simulation complete. Resetting."

His body respawned, intact, back at the corridor entrance. The laser grid reappeared, as precise as before.

"No… no no no no—"

Run. Laser. Dice. Respawn. Run. Laser. Dice. Respawn.

Over.
And over.
And over.

The Death Loop Tablet had no sympathy.
Mortillian Pikachu wasn’t a protagonist.
He was just another discarded data point.

Bonus Scene: Cramorant Beatdown in the Death Loop Bubble
In the endless corridors of the Death Loop Bubble, Mortillian Pikachu found himself in yet another randomized simulation room. This time, the floor was littered with fish bones—remnants of Gulp Missile victims. The air smelled faintly of saltwater and blood.

From the shadows, a flock of Cramorant boys emerged—each with scarred beaks, street punk vibes, and matching black bandanas loosely tied around their necks.
These weren’t ordinary Cramorants.
These were the Rowdy Beaks.

Mortillian Pikachu crossed his arms, smirking with that typical delusional bravado.
"Tch, water birds? Really? I thought this Death Loop Bubble was supposed to punish me. Y’all just fast food with wings."

The Cramorants paused.

"What? I’m not wrong. You guys are just stupid loot drop birds—"*

CRUNCH.
One Cramorant smashed its beak into Mortillian Pikachu’s gut, knocking the wind out of him.

"H-Hey—" WHACK—a second one clipped his face with a Gulp Missile fish.

Another Cramorant SPAT a Gulp Missile fish at his leg, knocking him over.
Before he could crawl away—the entire gang swarmed him.

THUMP. THWACK. CRUNCH. SMACK.
The stomps came mercilessly from all directions—beaks, webbed feet, missiles, feathers, anything.

"Tch—tch—wait, y-you can’t—"
SMACK.

"I-I’m still the—"
WHACK.

"The… the mai—"
CRUNCH.

"…n…"
SQUELCH.

They tore through his meat, shredded his fur, plucked his tail off like a chew toy.
One Cramorant stuffed Mortillian’s ear into its gullet, another scarfed his toes like appetizers.

Even if he hadn't insulted them, they would’ve devoured him anyway—it’s just that now, they were doing it with theatrical, joyful violence.

When his body fully collapsed into a splattered mess, the walls beeped again.

"Simulation complete. Respawn initiated."

Mortillian Pikachu’s form regenerated in a flash, pristine—only to see the Rowdy Beaks cracking their necks and ready for round two.

"N-No, wait, I’ll behave, I’ll—"

THWOMP.
No mercy.

Bonus Scene: The Ralts Incident — No Escape From Oblivion
After countless gang-stomps by the Rowdy Beaks, Mortillian Pikachu respawned into yet another randomized simulation room.

This time, it was strangely quiet.

The air shimmered with soft pastel hues. In the middle of the room, standing alone, was a small Ralts. Unknown gender. Innocent-looking. Their hands calmly held together, their helmet-like head barely tilting up to notice him.

Mortillian Pikachu’s tail bristled. His fur stood on end.

"No… NO—no way—no way, I know this trope—"
He backpedaled frantically.
"The little ones are the worst ones!!"

His paranoia screamed. In his twisted mind, even this Ralts could be the next executioner.

"You think I’ll fall for that ‘innocent kid’ setup?! I’m NOT dying to some storybook weakling! I’m the real—"
His eyes twitched. His pulse surged.

Mortillian Pikachu lunged, charging a Thunderbolt aimed straight for the Ralts’ head.

But the Ralts didn’t even flinch.

They simply whispered:
"…Moonblast Blackhole."

CRACK—BWOOOOOM.

A sphere of radiant energy instantly expanded into a collapsing blackhole, swallowing Mortillian Pikachu’s entire form in a fraction of a second.

His attack evaporated. His body stretched, spiraled, and then blinked out of existence.

The room restored itself quietly, like nothing happened.

The Ralts blinked once. "…Self-defense."
Then they walked away, leaving nothing behind.

Simulation complete. Respawn initiated.

Mortillian Pikachu rematerialized in a cold sweat, trembling. He clutched his head, mumbling in terror:
"Even the small ones… even the small ones…"

There was no bravado left. No swagger. No Pikachu Main Character Delusion.
Only perpetual fear.

Bonus Scene: The Author’s Pen
Somewhere deep within the Death Loop Bubble, Mortillian Pikachu staggered into yet another strange, sterile chamber.

This one was different. The walls shimmered like paper. The air tasted like wet ink.

He sneered. "Oh, what now? Is this where the so-called Author hides? C’mon, what are you gonna do—write me to death? Please."

He spat on the floor. "I’ve survived Cramorants. I’ve survived Ralts. I’ve survived your sadistic little loops."

He laughed bitterly, his fur scorched from countless deaths.
"You think I care anymore? You can’t scare me with your—"

SNAP.

A giant pen materialized in the air above him, its nib shimmering with fresh black ink.

Mortillian Pikachu froze.

The pen hovered, paused briefly as if savoring the moment, then pinched him mid-sentence like grabbing a bug off the page.

“Wait—WAIT—HEY—NO—”

SQUISH.

The pen scribbled him into a blot, smearing him across the white void of the room, erasing him as if he were a typo.

Silence.

The pen gently tapped the "page" twice, then flicked the residual ink away.

Somewhere, a soft echo whispered:
"Mock the Author? That's your worst gamble yet."

The Death Loop Bubble reinitialized.
Mortillian Pikachu respawned, trembling, whispering to himself:

"Even the Author… even the Author’s real…"

All deaths are canon. Even the ones not written yet.
The Author is watching.
