Bonus Scene: The Grid of No Return
Within the cold, clinical halls of the Death Loop Tablet’s deepest layer, Mortillian Pikachu wandered aimlessly, still clinging to his delusion of being the protagonist.

"There’s gotta be a way out… there’s always a way out for a Pikachu like me… I just need… a glitch, a cutscene, a rewind…"

He dashed down a sterile corridor, the walls lined with eerie reflective panels, chasing a nonexistent escape route.

Suddenly, the ceiling hummed.
A crisscrossing laser grid flickered to life, beams moving with cold, mechanical precision.

"Hah! I’ve seen this trope. I can dodge this. I’m Pikachu, I’m the ma, "

He zipped to the left, one laser grazed his tail.
He jumped forward, another laser sliced just before his ears.

"Tch, close… but easy. I’ll make it through, I always, "

The grid shifted patterns, 
A rapid checkered wall of lasers surged toward him.

His eyes widened in horror as he realized, 

This pattern was unsolvable. On purpose.

"W-Wait, wait, WAIT, CUT TO BLACK, SOMEONE, ANYONE, "

Schlick. Schlick. Schlick. Schlick. Schlick.

The grid passed through him like butter, cutting him into perfectly diced, equal-sized cubes. His last conscious moment was fragmented across those pieces, unable to process his own dismemberment.

The walls calmly beeped:
"Simulation complete. Resetting."

His body respawned, intact, back at the corridor entrance. The laser grid reappeared, as precise as before.

"No… no no no no, "

Run. Laser. Dice. Respawn. Run. Laser. Dice. Respawn.

Over.
And over.
And over.

The Death Loop Tablet had no sympathy.
Mortillian Pikachu wasn’t a protagonist.
He was just another discarded data point.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Bonus Scene: Cramorant Beatdown in the Death Loop Bubble
In the endless corridors of the Death Loop Bubble, Mortillian Pikachu found himself in yet another randomized simulation room. This time, the floor was littered with fish bones, remnants of Gulp Missile victims. The air smelled faintly of saltwater and blood.

From the shadows, a flock of Cramorant boys emerged, each with scarred beaks, street punk vibes, and matching black bandanas loosely tied around their necks.
These weren’t ordinary Cramorants.
These were the Rowdy Beaks.

Mortillian Pikachu crossed his arms, smirking with that typical delusional bravado.
"Tch, water birds? Really? I thought this Death Loop Bubble was supposed to punish me. Y’all just fast food with wings."

The Cramorants paused.

"What? I’m not wrong. You guys are just stupid loot drop birds, "*

CRUNCH.
One Cramorant smashed its beak into Mortillian Pikachu’s gut, knocking the wind out of him.

"H-Hey, " WHACK, a second one clipped his face with a Gulp Missile fish.

Another Cramorant SPAT a Gulp Missile fish at his leg, knocking him over.
Before he could crawl away, the entire gang swarmed him.

THUMP. THWACK. CRUNCH. SMACK.
The stomps came mercilessly from all directions, beaks, webbed feet, missiles, feathers, anything.

"Tch, tch, wait, y-you can’t, "
SMACK.

"I-I’m still the, "
WHACK.

"The… the mai, "
CRUNCH.

"…n…"
SQUELCH.

They tore through his meat, shredded his fur, plucked his tail off like a chew toy.
One Cramorant stuffed Mortillian’s ear into its gullet, another scarfed his toes like appetizers.

Even if he hadn't insulted them, they would’ve devoured him anyway, it’s just that now, they were doing it with theatrical, joyful violence.

When his body fully collapsed into a splattered mess, the walls beeped again.

"Simulation complete. Respawn initiated."

Mortillian Pikachu’s form regenerated in a flash, pristine, only to see the Rowdy Beaks cracking their necks and ready for round two.

"N-No, wait, I’ll behave, I’ll, "

THWOMP.
No mercy.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Bonus Scene: The Ralts Incident ,  No Escape From Oblivion
After countless gang-stomps by the Rowdy Beaks, Mortillian Pikachu respawned into yet another randomized simulation room.

This time, it was strangely quiet.

The air shimmered with soft pastel hues. In the middle of the room, standing alone, was a small Ralts. Unknown gender. Innocent-looking. Their hands calmly held together, their helmet-like head barely tilting up to notice him.

Mortillian Pikachu’s tail bristled. His fur stood on end.

"No… NO, no way, no way, I know this trope, "
He backpedaled frantically.
"The little ones are the worst ones!!"

His paranoia screamed. In his twisted mind, even this Ralts could be the next executioner.

"You think I’ll fall for that ‘innocent kid’ setup?! I’m NOT dying to some storybook weakling! I’m the real, "
His eyes twitched. His pulse surged.

Mortillian Pikachu lunged, charging a Thunderbolt aimed straight for the Ralts’ head.

But the Ralts didn’t even flinch.

They simply whispered:
"…Moonblast Blackhole."

CRACK, BWOOOOOM.

A sphere of radiant energy instantly expanded into a collapsing blackhole, swallowing Mortillian Pikachu’s entire form in a fraction of a second.

His attack evaporated. His body stretched, spiraled, and then blinked out of existence.

The room restored itself quietly, like nothing happened.

The Ralts blinked once. "…Self-defense."
Then they walked away, leaving nothing behind.

Simulation complete. Respawn initiated.

Mortillian Pikachu rematerialized in a cold sweat, trembling. He clutched his head, mumbling in terror:
"Even the small ones… even the small ones…"

There was no bravado left. No swagger. No Pikachu Main Character Delusion.
Only perpetual fear.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Bonus Scene: The Author’s Pen
Somewhere deep within the Death Loop Bubble, Mortillian Pikachu staggered into yet another strange, sterile chamber.

This one was different. The walls shimmered like paper. The air tasted like wet ink.

He sneered. "Oh, what now? Is this where the so-called Author hides? C’mon, what are you gonna do, write me to death? Please."

He spat on the floor. "I’ve survived Cramorants. I’ve survived Ralts. I’ve survived your sadistic little loops."

He laughed bitterly, his fur scorched from countless deaths.
"You think I care anymore? You can’t scare me with your, "

SNAP.

A giant pen materialized in the air above him, its nib shimmering with fresh black ink.

Mortillian Pikachu froze.

The pen hovered, paused briefly as if savoring the moment, then pinched him mid-sentence like grabbing a bug off the page.

“Wait, WAIT, HEY, NO, ”

SQUISH.

The pen scribbled him into a blot, smearing him across the white void of the room, erasing him as if he were a typo.

Silence.

The pen gently tapped the "page" twice, then flicked the residual ink away.

Somewhere, a soft echo whispered:
"Mock the Author? That's your worst gamble yet."

The Death Loop Bubble reinitialized.
Mortillian Pikachu respawned, trembling, whispering to himself:

"Even the Author… even the Author’s real…"

All deaths are canon. Even the ones not written yet.
The Author is watching.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Bonus Scene: One Million Years Later – The Grinding Wheel
The Death Loop Bubble endured.
And so did Mortillian Pikachu.

One million years had passed. His fur was matted with the ink of a thousand written deaths. His bones had been crushed, lasered, devoured, and pinched into nonexistence more times than numbers could measure. And yet, 
He still clung to it.
The Main Character Syndrome.

His voice cracked but never silenced.
“Pika Pika Pikachu, I’m the real one! I’m the main one! The chosen one! The rest are bootleg knockoffs, do you hear me? The universe is broken if I’m not at the center! Put me back! Put me back!”

He screamed at illusions.
Fabricated bosses. Phantom Ralts. Imaginary Ho-Oh. He fought shadows, fought empty simulations, fought against factory conveyor belts that didn’t even care to notice him.

And then, he stumbled into the drilled factory death simulation.

Rows of metallic arms spun their industrial drills, a monstrous line of grinders ahead.
The drills never stopped. They were never meant to.

He swaggered forward, taunting the room.

“Go ahead! TRY ME! I’ll Pika Pika yap until you reset this whole thing! I’ll yap forever!”

The conveyor belt pulled him forward.

Drilled.

Grinded.

Shredded into a smear of sparks and meat.

Reset.

Again.

“Pika Pika, still here, still the chosen one, ”

Grinded again.

Reset.

“Pika Pika, HAHA, try harder! I’m eternal, baby!”

Grinded again.

He kept talking. Kept yapping.
Every loop, his mouth still moved. His eyes still burned with delusion.

The factory didn’t care.
The Death Loop Bubble didn’t care.
The author didn’t even need to watch anymore.

He was grinding himself now.

The loops stretched longer because he made them longer.
His endless yapping, his endless fights with illusions, he willed his punishment to keep going, just to scream about his nonexistent throne.

The simulation adapted, accommodating his bottomless appetite for suffering.

Even after a million years, Mortillian Pikachu never regretted.
But everyone else, every reflection, every echo, even the fabricated enemies, 
They pitied him now.

And that was his final shame.
No one was angry anymore. No one cared.
Just pity.

But even that wouldn’t save him.
No one could bail him out.

Not even the Author.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Bonus Scene: The Punishment Timer
Somewhere deep in the Death Loop Bubble’s timeless machinery, Mortillian Pikachu respawned again, cracked but never silenced.

His eyes darted to the Punishment Timer.

969 googolplex years remaining.

“Pfft.” He scoffed, brushing dust off his own melted fur.
“Easy. I’ll cheese this. I’ll bail myself out. Piece of cake. Pika Pika.”

The universe said nothing.

He turned and saw an illusion of a Pinsir.
A fabricated opponent, generated to gnaw on him again.
Mortillian Pikachu flipped it off without hesitation.

“Hey, dumb beetle! Yeah, I’m talking to you! Your mandibles are crooked! Your horn’s got rust! I’ve seen Bidoofs scarier than you!”

The Pinsir silently approached.

The Punishment Timer flickered.

Now: 999 googolplex years remaining.

He blinked.
Then grinned.
“Hah! Bring it on! I got the power of, ” he paused for effect, holding his stubby arms out dramatically,
“Friendship! I’ll have allies! Someday. Someone’s gonna come for me! I’m the main one! The universe loves me! You’ll see! I’m destined for the hero route! The redemption arc!”

The Pinsir crunched forward without a word.

“Pika Pika,  I’m not done yet!”

Snap.

The jaws closed around him, splattering him into flickering bits, before the loop reset him again.

No friends came. No audience watched.
No one even remembered him except the Death Loop Bubble itself.

And that was his greatest agony, 
He believed in the impossible.
But the loop would never allow it.

Each insult only made the timer longer.
Each desperate claim only dug the hole deeper.

He would fight imaginary enemies until the end of time, with only the sound of his own broken voice to keep him company.

Pika Pika forever.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Bonus Scene: The Illusion of a Trainer
The Death Loop Bubble shifted.

This time, Mortillian Pikachu found himself standing in an open battle arena, metallic, clinical, cold.

Before him appeared a human boy illusion.
A cap tilted low, silent, carrying a Poke Ball.

The boy looked just like Red.

Mortillian Pikachu’s ears twitched in disgust.

“Tch! Oh no, no, no. You don’t get to be my trainer. I’m supposed to rule you. You little prop! I should be the one catching humans!”

The boy silently tossed the Poke Ball.

A flash.
The capture sequence began.

“WHAT?! NO, !” Mortillian Pikachu thrashed inside the Poke Ball.
“I am not your partner! You obey ME!”

Click.

The illusionary Red turned his cap backward and pointed forward.

From the far gate, the Pinsir illusion stomped in.
The same one. The same silent executioner.

Mortillian Pikachu screamed, “I command you to release me! I’m the hero! I lead the story! I don't fight for humans, I was born to dominate you!”

The boy remained silent. Just a gesture.

Battle begin.

Mortillian Pikachu lunged. Discharged. Screeched.
But his attacks fizzled into static, he was deliberately nerfed by the loop.

The Pinsir wasted no time.

Crunch. Snap. Pulverize.

Mortillian Pikachu was chewed into shreds, his body reduced to scraps and crumbs.

The illusory Red returned the Poke Ball to his belt.

The Pinsir and his illusionary swarm feasted on the mouse meat without hesitation.

When Mortillian Pikachu respawned in the next cycle, he snarled:

“Pika pika... next time I’ll win. Next time, I’ll make the trainer kneel.”

But the loop had already queued up the next capture.

And no matter what he believed,
he would always be someone else's pawn in that loop.

Forever.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

[Bonus Scene: The Insolent Timer]
Inside the endless void of the Death Loop Bubble, Mortillian Pikachu stood defiant, staring at the glowing punishment timer floating above him. Its cruel digits now displayed:

Time Remaining: (3 ↑↑↑↑↑↑↑↑↑↑ 3)² Years

Mortillian Pikachu scoffed, arms crossed, his ragged fur barely clinging to his battered body. "Yeah, sure, whatever. That’s just a prank. That’s a joke timer. I’ll crack it. I’ll break out. I’m the chosen one. I will win. Friendship, baby. That’s my ticket out."

No response.

The bubble’s cold silence hummed as a massive boulder materialized above him.

CRASH.
It flattened him into paste.

The bubble, as if savoring the humiliation, rewound his body, snapped his bones back together, and dropped the boulder again.
CRASH.

Mortillian Pikachu groaned but immediately got back on his feet. "Tch. Weak sauce. Gonna need more than that to, "

Without warning, the entire Death Loop Bubble's orbital path swung close to the Enefftian system's sun. The bubble’s surface shimmered, trapping the heat, cooking him slowly like a meat bun in an oven.

Mortillian Pikachu fried there for 65,536 years.

His flesh blistered, his screams echoed for centuries, but he never stopped taunting.

"Still standing! Bet! I’m still the main character! I’ll fight through this! I’ve seen worse in anime!"

The timer ticked up again.

Time Remaining: (3 ↑↑↑↑↑↑↑↑↑↑ 3)³ Years

Mortillian Pikachu stared at it, snorted. "Hah! Nice try. Not real. It’s all part of the game. Friendship will save me. Someday. Someone will come. They always do. They have to."

He looked up at the void with a broken grin. "I’m not losing. I’m just waiting for my arc."

The void, mercilessly apathetic, dropped another boulder.
CRASH.

He barely got out a "Pika Pi, " before it flattened him again.

And the timer?
It increased.

And Mortillian Pikachu?
He just kept talking. Just kept fighting illusions. Just kept dying.
Forever.

And nobody came.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Bonus Scene: The Delusion that Never Dies

69 million years later.

The Death Loop Bubble’s punishment timer now displayed a number so staggeringly vast, it made the prior googolplexes look like child's play:
(3 ↑↑↑↑↑↑↑↑↑↑↑↑↑↑↑↑↑↑↑↑↑↑↑↑↑↑↑↑↑↑↑↑↑↑↑↑↑↑↑↑↑↑↑↑↑↑↑↑↑↑↑↑↑↑↑↑↑↑↑↑↑↑↑↑ 3)³, chained with 64 arrows of tetration.

Mortillian Pikachu stared at it.
He grinned.
He laughed.
He mocked it.

“Heh! You think I’m scared of that number? I’ll outlive it! I’ll out-yap it! My destined trainer will come for me! I’m the chosen one, right? Right!?”

But the bubble had already decided.
The stalagmites impaled him, again.
One.
Two.
Three.
Four.
Each time more brutal, more mechanical, more emotionless.
65,536 times. In one cycle.

He screamed. He cursed. He laughed. He mocked the pain as if it would save him.

When it reset, he still said:
“My destined trainer will come! I’ll be free! I’ll have my story! My franchise! My Pika Pika glory! You’ll see! You’ll see!”

But the next stab was already coming.
And the next.
And the next.

The timer ticked up again, mercilessly stacking the years beyond the incomprehensible.

No rescue. No trainer. No friends.
Just his own rotting delusions.

And the Death Loop Bubble simply smiled silently.
