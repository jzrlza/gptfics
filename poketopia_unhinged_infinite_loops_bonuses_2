Bonus Scene: Eternal Love Play in Erosbloom-89
In the rose-gold streets of Erosbloom-89, where the skies shimmered like velvet and the wind carried faint traces of blooming eternity, the immortal Cheerleader Lurantis strolled leisurely, forever carrying her Quarterback Lurantis husband in her arms.

Her ponytail swayed with every step, her skirt fluttering in the fragrant breeze. His arms looped lazily around her neck, his expression bored but content.

“Hey babe,” she hummed, tilting her head down to him with a playful sparkle in her eyes.
“Hmm?” he responded, one antenna twitching in half-interest.

“Can I tear your face a little? Softly.” Her tone was casual, like asking to hold hands.

“Sure, go ahead,” he shrugged. “I’m a bored masochist anyway.”

Without skipping a step, she slipped a gentle claw under the side of his cheek and softly peeled back his face flesh, layer by layer, like carefully unwrapping a delicate candy.

The quarterback winced, but only just. “Oof. Still kinda stings.”

“Oh, you like it,” she giggled, savoring the moment as a love nibble.

But just then, a group of young Stellar Valiant girls, all armored up and fresh out of their hero academy, rounded the corner. Their leader, a brave star-wielding girl, stopped dead in her tracks.

“WHAT, WHAT IS HAPPENING?” she gasped, eyes wide in pure horror.
The other Valiants stared, jaws slack, one nearly dropping her stellar spear.

The quarterback, half his face now missing but regenerating with that wet shimmering pulse of immortality, lazily glanced at them.

“I’m fine,” he deadpanned.

The Cheerleader Lurantis gave the girls a sweet wink, still carrying him effortlessly.
“Get used to it,” she chirped. “We do this all the time.”

The Stellar Valiants huddled in panic, whispering furiously:
“Do we call… someone? Anyone?”
“I think they’re into it?”
“She’s carrying him like a princess while peeling his face!”
“Is this… romance?”

The cheerleader turned away, still giggling, still cradling her husband like her eternal plush toy.

“Come on, babe. Let’s find another street. I haven’t peeled your forehead yet.”

“Yeah, yeah,” he sighed with fake reluctance. “Make it hurt a little this time.”

“You got it.”

As they disappeared into the blossom-lined roads, the Stellar Valiants were left behind, forever scarred, forever confused.

“Erosbloom-89 is weird…” one of them whispered.

The sky twinkled above them, eternal and unbothered. Just another day in the life of cosmic, softly unhinged love.

Bonus Scene: The Blossoming Legacy of Softly Unhinged Love
In the golden dusk of Erosbloom-89, the immortal Cheerleader Lurantis continued to stroll with her eternal armful, her Quarterback Lurantis husband, comfortably carried like her precious plushie as always.

One day, while lounging on a floating petal bench, she paused mid-playful face-peeling and blinked.

“…Huh,” she muttered, patting her belly.
“What?” her husband asked, his voice muffled as she was gently stretching his cheek.
“I think I’m pregnant.”

He gave a slow, almost disinterested blink. “Oh. Neat.”

Months passed, not that time ever pressed on them, but the day finally arrived.

The Cheerleader Lurantis, still carrying her husband as usual, nonchalantly walked up to Erosbloom’s top nursery. A Divian human woman stood waiting at the entrance, dressed in soft robes shimmering with Fairy and Psychic energy, her smile practiced yet warm.

“Right here’s good,” the cheerleader said casually.

And in the middle of the flower-tiled courtyard, an egg slipped out from beneath her fluttering skirt. She held her husband a little tighter while watching the egg settle.

The Divian caretaker nodded, unfazed. “We will raise her well until she’s ready to find you. Congratulations.”

“Thanks,” the cheerleader grinned.
“Yeah, good luck,” added the quarterback, his face halfway healed from her earlier ‘playtime.’

One Million Years Later
Time rippled, but they remained unchanged.

The immortal couple now found themselves surrounded by thriving generations of their Grass and Bug descendants, a vibrant legacy blossoming across Erosbloom-89.

Many of their female descendants had fully embraced their heritage:

- Teasing boyfriends with the classic "Can I bite your head? Just a little?"

- Some boyfriends nervously laughed and let it happen with grace.

- Some panicked and ran, only to get playfully chased.

- Some negotiated peace offerings like… fish.

“Ah, the good ol’ panic and fish strategy,” the quarterback mused, watching a distant scene where a boy tried to barter with seafood.
His wife continued tearing his face with gentle precision in her arms.
“This really is a family tradition now, huh?”

“Yup,” she giggled, lovingly tearing his forehead. “A soft, playful legacy.”

“You know what?” he smirked through the mild stinging sensation.
“This is still way better than dealing with taxes and bills.”

“Right?” She squeezed him closer, triumphant.

Their descendants frolicked and teased, the cheerleader carried her quarterback, and the sky above stayed endlessly pink and gold.
Immortality didn’t mean everything had to be serious, sometimes, it just meant you had infinite time to love, play, and peel a little face now and then.
