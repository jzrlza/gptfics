Paper contents:
Page 1 :
i hope my notes are of some use
for many days passed to understand
as days stood still for those around me
seek knowledge where it can be found
read and learn to better yourself
repeat not your mistakes
take heed of the guiding stars
their colors will light the way
their patterns must be remembered
the temple is of utmost importante
for it holds the power of the crystal
and i have found its strength is my own
as well as those connected to me
a difficult choice i was given
but i was too weak for sacrifice
to those after me i pray for earnestly
as the sake of our realm and beyond
relios on the one who is selfless

Page 2:
the orator knows to eat of the
sunflower to sharpen their tounge

one who is skilled in magic shall
be even more so with snowfire

be wary of ouchtree
for little good can come of them

but ashroot shall make time for you 
appear as still as the stars in the sky

and if stars are what you wish to see
surely you require lava grapes

Page 3:
hello young mare it is because of you
that we write today in honor
for truth is written upon the slob
and if you truly seek unity
then you shall surely remember the word
the word passed down by those before
gait

Page 4:
an echo of the cycle
has been realized
the ability to manipulate
the swell of celestial bodies
in the heavens above
to reshape space
and manipulate time
if only it could be
tamed and controlled
for i ask what is not
possible with such a power?
and to those weakended by it
i have indeed healed
they tire not with a mixture of
one sunflower
three ash root
one lava grapes

Page 5:
what foolish fillies the lot of them!
do they not know of our temple?
can they not understand?
it is as timeless as the stars
and only with the power of the three
can time be undone
as it did before the fall
yes indeed a shadow corrupted mares
for their hearts ware hardened
and they thought only of themselves
not knowing themselves enough
to see the hurt was their own
and only with you my sisters
can the light shine yet again


Ancient Temple texts :
right middle :
bless three together
for whom the stars align
the ancient dwell within them
their souls are interwined
time be not continuous
as countless paths align
and with their love transcending
shall fruit upon the vine

top middle:
the consellations speak truth
when celestial bodies converge
one
five
seven
shall show the way
for this temple to shine the colors
of the heavens above

top left:
the sun by day the guardian of its realm
its moon by night the reflection of its light
and the crystal a gift from motherly stars
bridge to sister suns and daughter moons
their own gifts freely given and recieved
their warmth inspires soil to spring forth life
those who seek need only offer the yield
to splash the bounty upon the stones of this temple
for an alchemist cherishes all their ingredients
as they are gifts freely recieved to be given

middle left:
the elders may be gone but words remain
written for those who come after
our thoughts become yours
and we are one in spirit
produce a simple thought timelessly entrusted
as a token of out eternal unity
and thus may speak again through you
